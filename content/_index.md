# Hello, Hi, and Welcome!

## Who are you?

I'm Daniel, a follower of Jesus Christ, and I have a passion for teaching and inspiring others. You can find my personal website [here](https://danielsungsu.kim) to learn more.

## What is this?

**dayowrites** is a collection of notes, stories, and advice, that I wanted to share with the world.

## What's your goal?

My goal for this project is to provide some use to anyone who is interested in what I have to say.

## What will I gain from reading any of this?

I plan on writing a few short stories with the sole purpose of entertainment, but there's also a few "self-help" blog posts filled with advice ranging from fitness to tech that you may find helpful.

### University Notes

I used a variety of note taking strategies throughout my time at University. I've tried RemNote, Notion, Obsidian, GoodNotes, Evernote, OneNote, and Google Docs. My current workflow comprises of Obsidian, OneDrive storage, and GoodNotes on the tablet.

### Video Notes

Mindlessly watching YouTube videos was one of the things I hate most about my habits. Thus I started increasing my mindfulness by having my laptop out whenever consuming content and writing down what I learn or find interesting. This doesn't apply to the League of Legends pro matches I watch though.

### Sermons

I started taking digital notes during service about a year ago. It started as a means of staying awake, but it's turned into a reliable means of connecting adjacent ideas. I hope to continue building this library so that I can rely on it during hard times.

### Blog

The blog portion comprises of thoughts or connections that I've made in the past. I never planned on sharing my creative writing or thoughts, but then I decided, "What's the harm in it?".
