# Hi and welcome, I'm Daniel

## What is this?

Dayowrites is a culmination of written works that I deemed "shareable", but in reality a lot of it is illegible.

## What's your inspiration?

I always wanted to put myself out there, whether it be via a youtube channel or being active on forums but I was always too scared. Although this isn't necessarily where I want to be, I think that it's a good step forward.

## What's your goal?

My goal for this project is to write at least one post a month to continue developing my critical thinking and verbal communication skills.

## What will I gain from reading any of this?

I plan on writing a few short stories with the sole purpose of entertainment, but there's also a few "self-help" blog posts filled with advice ranging from fitness to career that you may find helpful.
