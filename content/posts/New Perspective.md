I'm so tired of it.

I've been chasing success for the good part of the last 4 years, and it doesn't take a genius to see that it's done more harm than good for me. I'm constantly unhappy with myself, and I rarely give myself grace when it comes to failing. There's this constant burden to work hard and it's been so suffocating and stressful.

It's a perpetual cycle of greed and dissatisfaction. And it's also done harm to the perception of my own image. I hate the way I look, I've developed an eating disorder to the point that I force myself to throw up at times. I constantly compare myself to peers and put myself down and harbor envy towards them.

And the worst part of it all, is that it's all in my head. Nobody cares. Everybody is living their own lives and worried about their own problems. It's honestly really self-centered to have these worries.

So from now on I'm going to operate differently. I'm going to focus on these goals:

- good health
- challenge myself
- practice gratitude

I will achieve this through daily journaling, mindfulness, proper diet, and active hobbies.
