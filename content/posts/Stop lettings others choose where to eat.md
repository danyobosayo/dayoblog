To go on a little tangent, I used to think that letting other people choose where to eat was the right thing to do. The nice thing to do, because you're letting them choose what they want to eat right? But often times, when people are given the responsibility of choice, they freeze up, they struggle to pick a place because they want to find a place that everyone wants to eat, but are not confident in doing so. This is why I find it so important for there to be someone that is willing to bear the brunt of choosing a place, even if that means being blamed when people are unhappy with the decision. It's better to lift the burden of having to choose away from someone else, and instead take it upon yourself.
