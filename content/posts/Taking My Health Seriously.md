Today's writing is going to be over my goals for the month of December 2024.
For far too long have I "understood" the importance of diet, sleep, and exercise to not make an active change in my lifestyle. It is finally time for this 20 year old boy to become a man and live a healthier life. My goals will be stated below for this month of December, and if I can just do this for one month, I'll be locked in for the rest of my life is my assumption.

- Follow the running app 6 week 5k training program
- Sleep before 1AM, and there is zero excuse for this one. 
- Charge all technology at the desk, not at the bed.
- Drink 40oz of water a day at the minimum
- No more snacks or sweets unless you're with your girlfriend. When you're alone you can only drink water.
- Journal daily and also measure weight
- Listen to Christian or classical music

And this is really all that I ask of you for this period of time.
It's not going to be easy. It's going to be really hard. Try not to mess up, but when you do, get back up.
