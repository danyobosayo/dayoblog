series: Acting in grace together

verse: James 4:1-12
How to build gospel centered communities.
Last week we learned we need wisdom, especially to deal with conflicts. 

We all desire change, to be better.
We want to be people that are reliable and can make a positive impact.
You get to experience this change, only when you become a peacemaker. When you live in close community with other christians. 

The problem of communities:
- They can be hurtful. 
- As James 4:1 says, what causes quarrels? That our passions are at war within us. 
- What kind of passions? Basically any desire, such as material goods, or our own well being.
- Stop focusing on yourself, and dedicate your life to others. 
- Look at your family, someone had to dedicate their time, money, effort, in order to nurture you. When nobody cares for you, you are hopeless. That is Hell. 
The solution:
- God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Stop operating with your own desires
- "You matter more than anyone else". NOT TRUE. stop being individualistic. You matter just as much as others. Stop prioritizing yourself and serve others.
- When you give to others, you're gaining life. When you try to gain life, you are experiencing spiritual death.
- Submit to God, and operate in the ways of Him instead of man. 
- Trust in what God says and do what he tells you to do. 

How can we experience a truly peaceful community together.

The devil wull do everything in its power to destroy communities. He will hinder us from humbling ourselves and submitting to God. When we follow others that are not God, you will destroy the community. 
RESIST the devil. RESIST him. The enemy is so powerful. Don't be afraid of the devil. 

Humulity is not thinking of your self as lesser, but thinking of your self fewer.
