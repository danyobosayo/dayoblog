## What is wisdom?
Put simply, it's **fearing the Lord**
According to verse 13, Wisdom is not just known, but is shown. "Let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom."
Wisdom is:
- Pure - Morally blameless
- Peaceable - people who dislike conflict. Put reconciliation into action. Means to work with others even though it's hard.
- Gentleness - As you hear good arguments, that you are willing to change. Flexible, yielding to others.
- Open to reason - Persuadable, a good listener
- Full of mercy - Taking your resources and putting it to use for others in need.
- Impartial - Show dignity and respect to all people, because we are all created in the image of God.
- Sincere - Integrity, be wise in public and in private.
We must show these things if have the desire to be wise. When we are wise, people will come to you, they will be drawn to these characteristics. 
## How can we implement it (how can we be wise)?
When we don't feel satisfied, we are constantly looking for something to make us feel content.
Our life feels unsettled and dissatisfied 
This will lead to all kinds of evil and addictions. We find ourseleves doing things we shouldn't be so that we can find "contentness".
But be careful that you don't fall into the trap of earthly wisdom. Money and possessions will not satisfy you. This will only lead to more discontent and chaos.

Furthermore, do not have an unsettled heart.
To escape this, we must humble ourselves and accept that God knows better than us. Accept the fact that he has the perfect answer, no matter what that answer may be.

If we pursue the will of God, we will have righteousness and peace. 

## What does God want when we're in conflict with one another. 
**Resolution and peace.** Duh. But it's not so easy amidst altercations.
> But how can we achieve this practically.

When we are in conflict because of our pride and our unsettled heart, we have to throw away that ego. Surrendering yourself to God is the quickest and most effective way to achieve this.
We can also become wiser by surrounding ourselves with wise people. 
## But be warned.
Our communities are **prone** to chaos, animosity, and conflicts because we are broken sinful people.
While it is possible for us to speak thousands of kind words to one another, just one evil word can poison and destroy it entirely.
## Call to action
Look upon Jesus, and you can see what true wisdom looks like. 
There's a gap of thousands of years, but his works still apply. 

It costs nothing to be wise. If you seek wisdom, just ask for it. Just go to Jesus and ask for it. We don't have to earn God's favor, by grace through faith, we can ask. 
## Questions:
**What drives your ambitions?**
**Are you trying to build YOUR own kingdom? or the kingdom of God?**
Daniel: Honestly I think that I derive a significant portion of my fulfillment through other people's opinions. I often try really hard to make others comfortable, sometimes at the cost of my own comfort, and I wonder whether or not that motivation derives from my own glorification or for the Lord's.
**Are you making peace in your community? How is God moving you to be gentle and open?**
Daniel: I think that everyone is prone to making judgments in their head, I for one am definitely a culprit of this. However, I try my best to keep it to myself, or better yet not even explore the idea.
**How does he convict you to show this wisdom to others?**
Daniel: I really enjoy talking about the sermons afterward with either the other college group members or even my friends who sat right beside me. I think many of us fall victim to the act of forgetting all about the sermon's message within a day or even the hour after the sermon.
**What can you do to promote more unity and peace in your cgs?** 
Daniel: Maybe I could reach out more and do some discipleship 1:1 with some other members? In general I need to pay more attention to others and what they're going through. Albeit it's not my responsibility to take care of the, showing that I care may make a big enough impact.
