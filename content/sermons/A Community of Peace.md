Peace makes peace

What is wisdom
- Fearing the Lord
- According to verse 13, Wisdom is not just known, but is shown. "Let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom."
- Wisdom is Pure - Morally blameless
	- Peaceable - people who dislike conflict. Put reconciliation into action. Means to work with others even though it's hard.
	- Gentleness - As you hear good arguments, that you are willing to change. Flexible, yielding to others.
	- Open to reason - Persuadable, a good listener
	- Full of mercy - Taking your resources and putting it to use for others in need.
	- Impartial - Show dignity and respect to all people, because we are all created in the image of God.
	- Sincere - Integrity, be wise in public and in private.
- We must show these things if you want to be wise.
- When we are wise, people will come to you, they will be drawn to these characteristics. 
How can we implement it

When we don't feel satisfied, we are constantly looking for something to make us feel content.
Our life feels unsettled and dissatisfied 
This will lead to all kinds of evil and addictions. We find ourseleves doing things we shouldn't be so that we can be "content".

Do not follow earthly wisdom, money and possessions will not satisfy you. This will only lead to more discontent and chaos.

Do not have an unsettled heart.
To escape this, we must possess heavenly wisdom. Humble yourself and accept that God knows better than you. Accept the fact that he has the perfect answer for you.

If we pursue the will of God, we will have righteousness and peace. 

What does God want when we're in conflict with one another. Resolution and peace. 
But how can we achieve this practically.
When we are in conflict because of our pride and our unsettled heart, we have to become wise people.

We can become wiser by surrounding yourself with wise people. 

Pur communities are prone to chaos ans conflicts becuse we are broken sinful people.

While we can speka thousands and millions if words to each other, just one evil word can poison it and dedyory it fully. 

Look upon Jesus, and you can see what true wisdom looks like. 
There's a gap of thousands of years, but his works still apply. 

It costs nothing to be wise. If you seek wisdom, just ask for it. Just go to Jesus and ask for it. We don't have to earn God's favor, by grace through faith, we can ask. 

What drives your ambitions?
Are you trying to build YOUR own kingdom? or the kingdom of God.

Are you making peace in your community? How is God moving you to be gentle and open. How does he convict you to show this wisdom to others. 

What can you do to promote more unity and peace in your cgs.
