## Intro:
Flushing the toilet in albania was mad awkward and ineffective? PJ also had trouble completing assignments because of technical difficulties with the laptop battery. Despite all of these difficult experiences in Albania, it ended up alright. This is because as humans, **we can adjust**. When PJ moved to the U.S, it felt like Heaven. He felt really blessed, but also **undeserving** of all this goodness. But the longer he lived in the U.S., the slowly became more desensitized. And this is an analogy for how as Christians, we become desensitized to the grace of the Lord. 
## Main Idea:
What has God provided to me that I've been overlooking? 
Have you become so desensitized to the constant provisions of the Lord, that you are left yearning for **more**?
I hope that we begin to understand that **everything that we have** is already enough. We should feel called and encouraged to obey the commandments because God has already done enough for us.
## God's Provision
In Verses 3-5, God is giving a command *(tell all the congregation of Israel, that on the 10th day of this month, every man shall take a lamb according to their father's households and sacrifice it for the Lord)* to the Israelites which feels ridiculous from their pov, especially because the Israelites are currently enslaved and impoverished. God is essentially commanding a community of slaves to sacrifice what little possession they have, and *throw it away* by sacrificing and burning any leftovers. 
## When should I obey God's Word?
There isn't a trigger or a certain provision that we must wait for in order to begin executing on our calling. It doesn't matter if you don't have the strength, knowledge, or faith or whatever it may be. These are all excuses. 
For example: 
"Lord once I start making more money, then I will do more service in the church."
"Lord I don't think that I'm qualified to evangelize and preach to others about the good news."

God has already given you **everything** that you need, so you must obey him immediately.
## Our perception can damage our relationship with God
Take the example of looking in the fridge for somethign and not finding it, and then your mom finds it immediately.
This is a classic case of as assumption of what we're supposed to be looking for. A certain bottle shape, a certain container. This limited vision can cause us to miss things that are right in front of us. And as a result, we sometimes come to God saying, "Why aren't you working in my life?", and begin doubting him.
Similarly, we miss the daily provisions of God. When we start correctly identifying **what God's power and provisions look like**, then we begin to observe and take note of it more frequently.
