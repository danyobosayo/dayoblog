series: Acting in grace together

verse: James 1:22-27
Be doers, not hearers. Anyone who claims to be a christian and has no heart to act upon it, is not a christian. Don't deceive yourself.

If you have any doubt about being a hearer and not a doer, you are simply a hearer. There's no gray area.

When we look into the bible, we should look intently. Look deeply. Don't glance at the bible as a man would look at himself in a mirror. Instead look as a woman would gaze at herself in the mirror. Look and hear and read and be absorbed into the perfect law. 

Experiencing the power of scripture can only occur when you intently meditate on it. See the weeds, blemishes, and sins in your own reflection.
