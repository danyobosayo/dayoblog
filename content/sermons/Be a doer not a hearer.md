#### verse: James 1:22-27
## Main Idea:
Be doers, not hearers. Anyone who claims to be a christian and has no heart to act upon it, is **not** a christian. Don't deceive yourself and truly reflect where your heart is in all of this.
## How do I know if I'm a hearer or a doer?
If you have any doubt about being a hearer or doer, you **are simply a hearer**. There's no gray area or confusion. If you can't confidently claim to be a doer, work harder to be in a position where you can.
## How does a doer operate?
When we open up and read into the bible, we should look intently. Look deeply. Don't glance at the bible as a man would look at himself in a mirror. Instead look as a woman would gaze at herself in the mirror. 
Honestly, this is kind of a crazy analogy but it kind of makes sense? Look, hear, and read and be absorbed into the perfect law. 
Experiencing the power of scripture can only occur when you intently meditate on it. See the weeds, blemishes, and sins in your own reflection.
