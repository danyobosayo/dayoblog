series: Blessed to be a blessing

verse: Genesis 12:2-3

We should focus on the proclamation.
Blessed to be a blessing is the theme of this year.
What does it mean to be biblically blessed?
	We have recieved something that we don’t necessarily deserve. (general understanding)

Throughout all of the bible theres a lot of worldly blessings promissed by God. Property, land, freedom, success. But after Jesus comes, you will rarely find these earthly blessings. Youll actually find afflictions and suffering up until Jesus’ ressurection. 
This is to show what it means to be under the blessings and provisions of God.

What does it mean to be biblically blessed?
	It means to be under the care, protection and favor of God.

In this way, we should be able to serve as leaders and inspirations to others. King Solomon is a good example of this.

The reason for Earthly blessings is so that we can be that beacon of light for others.
BUT after Jesus came, he showed the world that he is the direct SOURCE of all of these blessings. So the new testament is about sacrifice, suffering, and redemption.

Dont overly emphasize these earthly material blessings. 

Being blessed is truly just being in the presence of God. Not about comfort, just that God is with us. 

Who is blessed?
	Those who trust in God’s word.
