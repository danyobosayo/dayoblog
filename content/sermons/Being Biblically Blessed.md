#### series: Blessed to be a blessing
#### verse: Genesis 12:2-3 
## Main Idea:
We need to focus on the proclamation.
## What does it mean to be biblically blessed?
It means to have recieved something that we don’t necessarily deserve.
Throughout the entirety of the bible, there's a lot of **worldly blessings** promissed by God. Property, freedom, and success to name a few. But we can notice that with the arrival of Jesus, we rarely find the fulfillment of these earthly blessings. Youll actually find afflictions and suffering up until Jesus’ ressurection. 
This is to show what it means to be **under** the blessings and provisions of God.
## What does it mean to be biblically blessed?
It means to be under the care, protection and favor of God.
In this way, we should be able to serve as leaders and inspirations to others. King Solomon is a good example of this.
## The reason for Earthly blessings is so that we can be that beacon of light for others.
But after Jesus' arrival, he showed the world that he is the direct **source** of all of these blessings. So the new testament is about sacrifice, suffering, and redemption.
We should avoid emphasizing our earthly material blessings, but be mindful of these blessings too.
Being blessed is truly just being in the presence of God. It's less about the comfort/provisions, just that **God is with us**. Those who trust in God's word is **blessed**.
