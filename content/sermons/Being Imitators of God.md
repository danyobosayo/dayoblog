## Main Idea:
People by nature are imitators
Don’t imitate the world, imitate God

## How can we organically imitate God as Paul urges us to do?
As bad as it is, to perform immoral acts (ex: spreading hate, idolatery, sexual sun), it must not even be **mentioned**. Media and culture has normalized these things, essentially to the point we have become **desensitized**. The result of all these immoralities is a weaker connection to the Holy Spirit, and a lackingness to carry out God the Father's will.
## How do we combat our immoralities?
Believers are sealed by the holy spirit from the wrath of God. If you are constantly immoral, you must reflect objectively if you are really saved from Jesus. If you have experienced God’s grace, then you are to get rid of all of these things. 
Yes of course we fail (have some grace), but Paul is talking about a continuous indifferent attitude to all of these sins. And that is where the danger lies. Are we indifferent to the current issues of sexual immorality?
> Daniel: Personally I still struggle with pornography today. I used to masturbate **multiple** times a day, but fortunately I have cut it down to make 2-3 times a month now. Still trying to beat it entirely though.

The root problem of all of these desires is that they *dethrone* God from the center of our lives. Simply put, it's idolatry. When we pursue these things, we are telling God “you are not enough for me”. 
## What do imitators of God look like?
Imitators of God walk in wisdom, light, and spirit. To list a few concrete examples:
- Walk in love
- Expose darkness
- Take **no part** in these evil actions
- Live fruitfully as children of God
- Express devotion

Simply put: *We have to live in the righteousness of God*

There’s no list of commands to obey. If we follow a list it becomes a legalistic relationship instead of true faith.
## How can we be more Christ like?
An effective and applicable way to be more Christ like is to be in a constant state of thanksgiving.
- When you are someone who **constantly** gives thanks, it humbles you. It means that God is enough for us. We are away from pride. We acknowledge our sinfulness, our brokenness, and give all glory to God.
Gospel obedience works only when we realize how unworthy and condemned we are.
