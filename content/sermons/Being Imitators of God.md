verse: Ephesians 5:1-21
# Imitators of God
People by nature are imitators
Don’t imitate the world, imitate God

> “How can we organically imitate God as Paul urges us to do”

It’s not just the performance of immoral acts, it must not even be mentioned. Media and culture has normalized these cruel things. To the point we have become desensitized. The result of all these immoralities is a loss of inheritance and God’s wrath will be upon us.

Believers are sealed by the holy spirit from the wrath of God. If you are constantly immoral, you must reflect objectively if you are really saved from Jesus. If you have experienced God’s grace, then you are to get rid of all of these things. Yes of course we fail, but Paul is talking about a continuous indifferent attitude to all of these sins. And that is where the danger lies. Are we indifferent to the current issues of sexual immorality?

The root problem of all of these desires is because those are all things that dethrone God from our lives. It’s idolatry. When you pursue these things, you are telling God “you are not enough for me”. 

Imitators of God walk in wisdom, light, and spirit. This lifestyle looks like this
- Walk in love
- Expose darkness
- Take no part in these evil actions
- Live fruitfully as children of God
- Express devotion

> You have to live in the righteousness of God

There’s no list of commands to obey. If we follow a list it becomes a legalistic relationship instead of true faith.
**How can we be more christ like?**
- ==But instead let there be thanksgiving==
	- When you are someone who constantly gives thanks, it humbles you. It means that God is enough for us. We are away from pride. We acknowledge our sinfulness.
- Evil things are unfitting of Christians.
- Embrace the renewed mind
- Gospel obedience works only when we realize how unworthy and condemned we are.
