## To follow Jesus, we have to be willing to sacrifice
As seen within these verses, a man wants to follow Jesus, but has **important** things to do such as saying good bye to his family or burying his father. And yet Jesus calls him to drop everything and still follow him.
It is difficult to **make a promise** to Jesus that you will follow him earnestly. You have to be ready and willing to sacrifice everything that you desire to carry out his plan. 
But sacrifice doesn't have to be impossible or incredibly difficulty. On the contrary, sacrifice can be an **opportunity** to show your *love and devotion*. We are presented with opportunities to sacrifice for Jesus everywhere we go, it is up to us to take it.
Be careful that you don't think of sacrifice as draining or taxing on oneself. You may believe that *constantly sacrificing* oneself will eventually lead you to feeling burnt out, but this shouldn't be the case because our God is empowering us and will allow us to do whatever is possible.
## To follow Jesus, we have to be willing to put Jesus first
We must stop caring about the opinions of people on this Earth, rather make God's opinion the most important thing. In other words, stop placing so much value on worldly perspective.
So many of us tell ourselves, "Ah after I figure this out", "After I lock in that internship", "After I get that promotion", and we continue to put other things before Jesus. But there will never be a **perfect opportunity** to follow Jesus. Instead, we are called to do what we can **right now**, in whatever season we may find ourselves in, to glorify the Lord. So stop waiting, and just listen. Listen to what God is telling you to do and act. 
## To follow Jesus, we have to persevere
Essentially, once we commit to Jesus, we cannot go back to our old ways. Our slate has been wiped clean by the death and ressurection of the Son of God Jesus Christ. Through that, it is possible for us to have a relationship with God and have eternal life. Thus we must act upon this fact and not let his grace go to waste.
