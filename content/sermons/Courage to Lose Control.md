verse: Daniel 4:28-37
King Nebuchadnezzar is humiliated and humbled because he was so prideful. Not just a boastful nature, but a **spiritual pride**. 

Do we have spiritual pride?

Spiritual pride leaves to an obsession with control. Nebechadnezzar thinks that the fruits of his labor all came by his own doing. Spiritual restoration occured when he let go of his control and gave all glory to God most high. 

When we have the courage release our control and pride to God, then we actually experience such great complete peace. Not just temporarily, but eternally. Letting go isn't losing something, it's allowing God to lead our lives.

How can we become courageous to lose control?
	You have to look up and toward God and recognize his greatness, and our lowliness. Understand that he is **WORTHY** of our devotion.
	Allow our struggles to ignite our hearts and humble ourselves. When we go through hardship, we need to understand that we never even deserved to live. So we should be joyous as we go through difficulties.
- Control will kill our joy and peace in any situation (good or bad). 
	- Look at Daniel 4 where the king is content and at ease because his kingdom was prosperous. His life was flourishing, and yet in verse 5 he quickly became afraid because of a dream. 
	- His joy and peace was incomplete. So as easily as he can obtain prosperity, he can lose it. The natural order of life is becoming anxious. Because when we are up, we are anxious to stay up. And when we're down, we arr anxious to get up.
	- The king places his identity within his own glory and prosperity. So the thought of losing it has completely taken over his mental state.
- Having a heart of humility id knowing that we don't deserve anything. We have to admit that we are prideful and recognize how **everything** in this life is a gift. Every breath we take, every bite of food. We depend on God for everything. 
- We feel powerless when we lose the very thing we thought we could control. The best example of this id our own lives. We assume we get to live and control our own lives, but the irony is that we become more controlled and powerful by giving it all to god.
- When we look for relationships that glorify ourselves we are prideful and sinning. Pride makes us look for people to match our needs, rather than us matching other's needs. 
- Community groups do not exist to meet your needs. It's to meet the needs of other people.
- God honors those who honor him. 
- Proper worship is one way to honor God. Worship is not about us, it's about God. Practicing proper worship helps us to get back on track. It will fuel courage to lose control. 
- Come to Church as a servant, and not just as a consumer. Participate, be active and involved.
