series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith

verse: Daniel 8:27
Context: This terrible ruler, the king of Greece, was desecrating the church and persecuting the Jews. Daniel had a terrible vision of this that it brought him illness. But even then, we find that in verse 27 that he rose and "went about the king's business". He remains **courageously consistent** although he was facing overwhelming fear and hardship.

When life is overwhelming and uncertain, how can we also remain courageously consistent just as Daniel was. Because we can't so this by our own power.

##### Why is endurance better than fleeing from difficult times? 
- Endurance fills us with peace and also frees us from control. 
- If we don't endure but instead we flee by acting rashly or shutting down or compromising our values, we are trying to take our **own control** of the situation. 
	- But when we do this, we lie to ourselves thinking that we will feel better, but this is a temporary solution. It's instant gratification. 
- Example: A family that is comfortable and happy and loving. But dad feels like if they ha djudt a little more money they'd be set. An opportunity arises to work abroad and make a lot more money. The family agrees and he makes more. But eventually the family falls apart as the father grows distant and has less of an image. The loneliness of the father leads to an affair and then the entire family is broken. 
	- The father didn't endure. He tried to take control of his own destiny???? Wait i don't get it. In hindsight it was a poor decision, but i feel like before that it wasn't that rash a decision. 
##### What is endurance?
- It's not to just "suck it up" and sit in suffering. 
- Rather it's "ordinary faithfulness for extraordinary purposes". 
- No matter what situation Daniel found himself in, he remained faithful and had daily obedience. 
- Making moves not based on your preference, but rather God's direction. 
- Doing the same mundane things every single day. God uses this ordinary faithfulness to fulfill his will. 
- The principle of consistently doing what is **required** of us gives everything meaning. Things like
	- keeping the room clean
	- doing your work
	- studying
	- talking to your friends, building relationships
##### Where does Endurance come?
- Endurances comes from seeking to understand God's plan.
- He's seeking to find what God's will is.
- Through the lens of the gospel truth, our suffering has purpose. 
- God uses hard times to shape us to the image of Christ. 
- Our hope is secured no matter what we face because Jesus has endured and has suffered for our sakes. 

Choosing to be consistent in our daily matters, is much better than looking for extraordinary options as a solution to our problems.
