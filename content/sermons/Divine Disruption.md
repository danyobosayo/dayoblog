series: The God who remembers

verse: Exodus 3:1-4
- Moses is running away after killing an Egyptian worker for mistreating a Hebrew. 
- In this set of verses, Moses finds an eternally burning bush.
	- Note that we can easily consider this a miracle, however it is also not so easily observed. 
## Main Idea
There are moments when we go to God asking for something we desire or feel like we need. But sometimes God answers us by making life more difficult/troublesome. There are often things that we don't realize need to be addressed until God tells us they need to be fixed.

## What is a divine disruption?
- **A quiet invitation, hidden in an ordinary interuption**
- God often reveals himself in a quiet and gentle fashion. 
- But why isn't he so extravagant/flashy?
- Because God desires our genuine **attention**. Just like he doesn't force us to love or believe in him, he also reveals himself in subtle ways to train ourselves to recognize his character.
### Idea: There's burning bushes all around us, but we miss them.
- It's not a question of *whether or not God is there*, but a matter of us noticing how he's working in our lives.
- Humans  have a tendency for comfort, and regularity. We want to accomplish **our own agenda**. However these burning bushes will often cause you to *change course* to fulfill **God's agenda**. 
## What's the point of these burning bushes?
- To gain a better understanding of **who God is**.
- God calls us not to be stuck on this world, but to be saved by his Son.
- We are people who are born again with a new purpose.
## How do we recognize divine disruption?
- If we look at verse 3, we notice that Moses had to **turn aside** in order to confront the burning bush. Note that the burning bush didn't call out to Moses or get his attention. Moses noticed the bush by his own accord.
- Thus we must **step out of our routine, out of our comfort** in order to look towards God. Really look for the ways he's working in your life.
- We are the problem, and the only thing we need to change is ourselves.
## Call to action
- Stop moving so quickly and just pause. Turn towards God and listen for him.
- It will help us to see and understand that our purpose isn't to just live in this world, but that God has called us for a greater purpose for his plan and for his glory.
