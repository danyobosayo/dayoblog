#### series: Steadfast faith
#### verse: Daniel 3
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are cast into the fire for not worshipping Nevuchadnezzar's idol. They survive through the power of Jesus Christ. 
## Main Idea:
We are human. We have fears of failure and an expectation of loss. We all live in **fire**.
So how can we hold on to our convictions without being consumed by the fire?
**Pluralism**-> What we think about the **most** is our "god". 
## When does suffering consume us
When we stop focusing our time and attention on God. If the suffering/grief is so painful that it retracts us from God, then it is consuming us.
## How does God deliver us in those moments.
Through an encountering with Him. Recognize his presence and in his divine protection. He will be **WITH** us through hard moments *rather than removing* them. And this is because our God is relational, not a wish maker. He cares and loves us and relates with us. A personal encounter with God in these hard times reaffirms our love and faithfulness with God.
## What do we do to hold on to these convictions.
Focus on the "fourth man" and not on the fire/heat. Be confident and focused on God. Recognize that God is constantly walking with us in every step of our journey.
## Prayer
Father as you have lead your son to suffer with us. I pray that this truth be so REAL in our hearts and our lives. This truth would be so valuable that we would give our life and everything for you. That we would not be shaken by the values of this world but instead believe in your words and walk in a way that is pleasing to you. Make this genuine as we meditate together in the suffering of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Convict our hearts and draw us closer to you that we may leave this place today transformed and conformed in your likeness.
