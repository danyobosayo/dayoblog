series: Acting in grace together 
verse: James 1:19-21
- "19 Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; 20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. 21 Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."

##### What does a biblical community look like?
Graciously acting together. The most important part of christian life is to be a "born again believer". A life that is fully influenced by christ. Born against isn't sinless, but toy should have a pursuit of a different kind of life. 

If you have truly accepted Jesus Christ, you get to experience not just eternity and salvation, but also a new freedom. He naturally changes our heart, to know what is right and wrong. We have the truth within us. 

"The manual of life"
The word of God is a necessity. 

##### We consume so much data everyday so much content. But how much of that is God's word?
This is what can suffocate us. We stop hearing of our God, and hear more of our world. 

Our pride makes us quick to anger, slow to hear, because it makes us not rely on him. We say, "I don't need the bible to know what is right or wrong" and it leads us to misery. The opposite of this is humility. We need to have humility. Receive the implanted word with meekness. 

Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but rather thinking of yourself less.

We must fully accept the bible in its entirety, and not just partially. To know the real living God, you must know the bible and accept it in its entirety.

We sometimes put limits on our God. "God you empower me to be capable of X, but I don't think i can do Y". This mentallity speaks volumes. It says that you don't trust God, and that you are prideful. 
It is undeniable that God is working in us and that he is always there for us. 
Stop praying to God begging for power. It is up to you to accept his love and help. Thus we need to humble ourselves in every manner. Be humble before God, be humble before the living word, be humble and a servant to others.

Deny the flesh. 
Have a heart to make it work
Do the uncomfortable
Do the unthinkable.
Love on Jesus in every moment
Actively remind yourself of God.
