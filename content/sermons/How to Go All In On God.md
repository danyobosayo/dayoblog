1. Recognize how weak and insignificant you are.
	1. You are not as righteous as you are
2. Jesus tells us to "take from me" his righteousness
	1. Go to Christ and ask for his help to be righteous
3. Shake God's hand
	1. Shaking hands is a classic greeting that we often use when we invite someone into our home. We need to invite the holy spirit into our hearts, welcome God into our lives.
4. Jesus will come into our lives and will eat with us
	1. We will share a meal together, a very intimate experience. God doesn't want just a small snack or entree. He wants to spend the entire evening together, all the way to dessert.

Main takeaway
- Jesus immersed himself completely within Hell, pain, fire, and suffering for **our sakes**. Recognizing this should help us to grow a fiery passion to invite him into our lives and look toward God.
