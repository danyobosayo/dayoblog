#### series: Acting in grace together
#### verse: James 4:1-12
Last week we learned we need wisdom, especially to deal with conflicts. 
## Main Idea:
We all desire change, to be better.
We want to be people that are reliable and can make a positive impact.
You get to **experience** this change, only when you become a **peacemaker**. When you live in close community with other christians. 
## The problem of communities:
They can be hurtful. 
As James 4:1 says, what causes quarrels? That our passions are at war within us. 
What kind of passions? 
- Basically any desire, such as material goods, or our own well being.
So we need to stop **focusing** on **ourselves**, and dedicate your life *to others*. 
Look at your family, someone had to dedicate their time, money, effort, in order to nurture you.
- When nobody cares for you, you are hopeless. That is **Hell**. And of course we want to avoid experiencing this "hell" ourselves, but you need to make it a priority to prevent others from experiencing it.
## The solution:
God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Stop operating with your own desires

>"*You matter more than anyone else*". 

This is a false statement.
- We need to stop being **individualistic**. You and everyone else matter *equally*. Stop prioritizing yourself and start **serving others**.
When you give to others, you gain life. 
On the contrary, when you try to gain life, you are experiencing spiritual death.
- Essentially what this means is that when you make a great effort whilst focused on yourself, you will gain nothing. But it is when we give everything that we have, that we actually *gain*.
Submit to God, and operate in the ways of Him instead of man. 
Trust in what God says and do what he tells you to do. 

## How can we experience a truly peaceful community together.
The devil will do everything in its power to **destroy** communities. He will hinder us from humbling ourselves and submitting to God. When we follow others that are *not* God, you will destroy the community. 
**RESIST** the devil. The enemy is powerful, but incomparable to our God. Don't be afraid of the devil. 
Try to shift your focus towards God and away from other things whether it be social status, material goods, wealth, or whatever other idols you may have in your life.
