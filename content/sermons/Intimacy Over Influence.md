#### verse: Daniel 11:32-12:3 
## Context:
Verse 32 Group of believers that resisted the temptation. 
Verses 36-45 Future ruler (antichrist) is foreshadowed. King is exalting himself proclaiming that he is the god of gods. 
## Main Idea:
Humans have an inherent desire to **belong**.
* People are drawn towards comfortable and relatable people. 
* But the reality (and potential pitfall) of church is that we can potentially start prioritizing the **community**, which in turns *prioritizes ourselves*, over God.

We as Christians simply don't pursue **intimacy** over **influence**.
## How does the world pressure us to change?
It offers us temporary acceptance and comfort at the **cost** of eternal identity. 
For a lack of a better example: say a company offers you a job with a great pay, but imagine they want you to work on sundays? 
"Just compromise a *little* bit and we can give you whatever you want". That's the voice of the **enemy**. And when we start to give in to this little voice, it becomes *easier* to make drastic decisions that **separate** us from God.
## How does knowing God give us a deeper belonging that culture ever can?
The followers that **truly know** their God (trust, obedience, intimately) will recognize that this identity as his children is **unwavering**. And unwavering Christian means to walk with God and stand firm against cultural pressures. 
## How can we eventually live with the confidence where we do not have to continue chasing belonging and acceptance?
When we belong to God, there is **no need** to *adapt* and change the way we carry ourselves depending on circumstance. We are permanently children of God and nothing in this world can change that. Confidence in ourselves doesn't come from fitting in, but from standing firm in God's truth. 
Whenever you doubt, look at the life of Jesus and the Word. Jesus is the complete relevation of God. On a separate note, if you want to know God intimately, you need to know Jesus Christ. Jesus is the **source** of knowing God deeply.
