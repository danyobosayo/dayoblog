verse: Matthew 11:25-30

To know Jesus as the son of God is an invitation to rest.

Jesus reveals the father to those he chooses?
He invites weary sinners into his rest.
Verse 25, Jesus declares himself as the promised Messiah.
God is easier to understand when you notice all the love he has for us.
Jesus is unique as he is THE son if God. Jesus transcends.
A lot of the time we discuss how Jesus is similar to us. He is born in the flesh, suffered, and died. But at the same time he is not like is at all. He is unrelatable, intangible.
God reveals himself to us and it's a gracious decision. God is dealing with a race of sinners of which he owes nothing.
Why should we be happy that he hides and reveals. Because he has revealed it to us. We are his little children. Though we are sinful. we were help
God invites thiose that are tired and burdened.

We need the local church so that sin doesn't permeate within us. Weekly church, touches with God, prayer and praise. All of these things allow us to be comfortable.
