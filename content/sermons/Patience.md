series: Acting in grace together

verse: James 5:7-12
Be patient. Some of you may not be wealthy, maybe suffering, maybe oppressed. But god is exhorting them to be patient. 

We seek immediate gratification. We are products impatient 

Patience -> graciousness and steadiness at the face of delayed gratifications.

Patience can also mean: Long suffering and remaining steadfast and endure and presevere. 

Not stoicism. It's not about willpower to withstand irritation. It's deeper and more than that. 

Stoics that try not to be overwhelmed, relies on your own self. It's not gonna work every time. If you rely on oneself, it's not gonna work everytime. So when you do inevitably fail, you have nobody to blame but yourself. 

Hupimenoh - endurance despite what im going through.

The story of Job:
He lived righteously. He was wealthy, healthy, and basically just thriving. He was almost a perfect role model of a good Christian. But Satan comes and tests him by stripping him of every material thing he has. Patience is enduring and believing that God is still compassionate, merciful, and that he has a perfect will. This is the kind of patience that James is talking about. Not the suprression of your feelings.

Be patient until the coming of the Lord. His kingdom will be established, no more suffering or tears

What is the opposite of patience?
Grumbling. Complaint. Selfpity. The absense of peace creates destruction within us. When you have self pity, and keep thinking about yourself, you will be totally self centered. The outcome of having this self centered mindset, is the destruction of your own life and the lives of others. You no longer put a focus on to others but only yourself. 

Patience creates peace and rest within us. We can be patient mids
