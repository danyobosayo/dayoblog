#### series: Acting in grace together
#### verse: James 5:7-12 
## Main Idea:
Be patient. Some of you may not be wealthy, maybe suffering, maybe oppressed. But god is exhorting them to be patient. As sinful humans, we seek immediate gratification. 

Patience -> graciousness and steadiness at the face of delayed gratifications.

Patience can also mean: Long suffering and remaining steadfast and endure and presevere. 
## Patience vs Stoicism
Stoicism in practice has a lot of benefits, but one severe lacking issue is the dependence on oneself. 
But patience is not about willpower to withstand irritation. It's deeper and more than that.    
Stoics that try not to be overwhelmed, relies on your own self. It's not gonna work every time. If you rely on oneself, it's not gonna work everytime. So when you do inevitably fail, you have nobody to blame but yourself. 

*Hupimenoh* - endurance despite what im going through.

Let's take a look at the story of Job:
He lived righteously. He was wealthy, healthy, and really could not ask for more. He was a near perfect role model of the ideal Christian. But Satan comes and tests him by stripping him of every material thing he has. Patience is the act of **enduring and believing that God is still compassionate, merciful, and that he has a perfect will**. This is the kind of patience that James is talking about. Not the mere suppression of your feelings.

Be patient until the coming of the Lord. His kingdom will be established.

## What is the opposite of patience?
Grumbling. Complaint. Selfpity. The absense of peace creates destruction within us. When you have self pity, and keep thinking about yourself, you will be totally self centered. The outcome of having this self centered mindset, is the destruction of your own life and the lives of others. You no longer put a focus on to others but only yourself.
