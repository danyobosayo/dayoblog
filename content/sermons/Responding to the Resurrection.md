#### guest speaker: Pastor Thomas 
#### verse: John 20:11-18 
Mary sees Jesus at the tomb but doesn't recognize him. She's there early in the morning before sun rise and demands to see him.
## What is the proper response to the resurrection?
It's a lifestyle of worship. Which means every aspect of our lives is glorifying to God. 
## Make worship into a lifestyle through commitment
This means prioritizing God even when it's **inconvenient**. Waking up early to pray, volunteering, sacrificing the weekend, etc.
We need to remind ourselves constantly the magnitude of the resurrection, and if you truly believe in it, then there should be a genuine change reflected in our identity and actions. You need to devote yourself to Christ, **regardless of the circumstance**.
## Make worship into a lifestyle through obedience
Obeying without delay or hesitation is true obedience. In the verses, Jesus commands Mary to share the good news that he has risen again, and without hesitation, she goes into the city and proclaims it. 
We don't get to choose when we get to "be a christian". It should permeate through your every being at all times, for the holy spirit dwells within us. 
Obedience is not ahout following a set of rules. It's about having a genuine loving relationship with God. We should feel encouraged to do *more* than just follow the commands. 
## Call to action
What is God asking of you to obey?
- is it a bad habit?
- to forgive someone unconditionally?
- to move your path into a place of ministry?
When we leave this place today, let's remember that our worship did not end. It's not tied to a physical place, rather to our bodies.
