#### series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith 
#### verse: Daniel 7:15-28 
## Context:
- A man receives a direct vision from God. 
- The 'ancient of days' executes judgment. 
- Daniel holds on to the tension of not knowing. He doesn't demand understanding, but instead continues to rest in both the unknown and peace.
## Main Idea:
People are generally restless with the unknown. We seek answers at every turn. But finding the answer won't result in peace. Often times the answer isn't clear, thus the increase in knowledge leads to confusion. 
## Why is knowledge alone insufficient to bring peace? 
- knowledge can *inform the mind* but it's not capable of settling the heart, and this is an incredibly important distinction to make. No amount of worldly knowledge can compare to the peace of faith.
## How do we feel peace? 
- By trusting in the one that provides us life. Trust in God. God is always ruling, in control, and omniscient. To truly know and understand this should bring your an indistinguishable peace.
## How can we respond when clarity hasnt come?
- How can we rest in the unknown? 
- Verse 28, look at how Daniel responds. 
- Daniel kept it to himself and in his heart. Sort of bit his tongue, and didn't act recklessly or freak out. So how was he able to rest?
	- Daniel has been seeing a lot of visions recently and has been experiencing confusion/turmoil.
	- Fix your eyes on the cross. On our redeemer. 
- As we deal with uncertainty (no matter what it is), be at rest in knowing that God is in control and he has a plan for us.
