#### series: The God who remembers 
#### verse: Exodus 2:1-10 
## Context:
- The story of Moses' birth. His mother hid him in the reeds and the Phaoroh's daughter decides to spare his life. She names him Moses because she, "*Drew him out of the water*"
- Admist a chaos for the Israelites, the mother of Moses sees it differently.
	- Instead of fearing for her child's life, she instead has a vision similar to God's.
- It's important to note that the mother deems her son as, "Fine" or in Hebrew, "Tov". Which directly translates to **Good**. This echos the ideas from Genesis 1, where God found things Good. It wasn't about the child's physical appearance. It was about his *character* and she found it good.
## Main Idea:
Obviously as humans, we have a tendency to react things in a worldly manner. But how much more joyful and at peace could we be if we saw things the way God sees it?

## How can we describe God? 
- He remembers or better yet, never forgets.
- He's not distant at all, rather he draws near to us.
- He is a moving God that is constantly working within our lives.

Goal: See as God sees by recognizing his **perspective** more often. 
>"Train your eye"
## God sees goodness where others see a problem
News Flash: We care more about how we think about ourselves more than we value other people's opinions. Your biggest criticizor is **yourself** because you know yourself better than anyone. 
You can either spend your life trying to make yourself **ideal in the eyes of society, or be content in the lens of God**. Not through the lens of performance, money, physical appearance, but through the lens of God's purposes.
## God sees redemption when we see ruin
In the passage, the mother tries to keep her child hidden away and protected from the searches for 3 months. But when she couldn't bear it any longer, God takes over. But why does God wait this long, let the mother suffer with the turmoils and stress of hiding a baby? 
- God waits for us to deplete our options because he desires **full trust and surrender in him**, not just a partial commitment. God is the **only hope**... **the only answer**. 
Consider your suffering a joy, because in the midst of your problems, you can see how God is keeping his covenant and his faithfulness.
Long story short, focus on the redemption, not the ruin.
## God executes his plan through people we least expect
In the passage, we see the Pharoh's daughter as a central figure in Moses' story. Nobody could expect her to spare Moses' life because she is a direct descendant of the government that is trying to kill all baby Israelites. God is not the God who **we think he is**. God has a purpose beyond what we can comprehend. But how then can we trust in God or see how he sees things? Isn't it far too difficult? Surround yourself in the Word, in his people, and in his presence. We cannot begin to fathom the complete picture, but we can make an effort every single day to know just a little more than we did the day before.
## How can I take action and see as God sees the world?
If you look at the life of Jesus, he lived a life of complete suffering. It was about service, and stewardship. He was mocked, scorned, and cruficied. The Son of God, the Son of Man. 
No matter the circumstance, try to see it as God sees it. In our time of suffering, chaos, and uncertainty. God has not forgotten you. He is always with you through every step of the way.
Simply look at the cross.
