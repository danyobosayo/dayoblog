#### verse: Mark 6:30-32 
## Main Idea:
The world is fast, we prioritize speed and efficiency. 
If we don't take time to recognize God and feel his presence, life and time will slip right past you.
We need moments to absorb and reflect what we're going through in order to avoid the effect of missing what is happening or recognizing what you've been through.
### Christ Calls to Calm
Mark 6:30-32
Take a break. Reset yourself.
Intentionally seek God and retreat. Spend time with God in solitude and silence. It is in within these moments that we can become the most vulnerable and honest with ourselves.
### Secret Solitude
Mark 1:35
Enjoy solitude with God and unwind. Especially when we get caught up in the busyness of our lives. Wake up early and just spend time with God. Really put in the effort to build a greater relationship with God.
### Pause Purposefully
A lot of people look at social media or watch netflix to rest. 
But it actually does the opposite. It's just an escape. 
>"How do we reenergize ourselves and have meaningful rest?"

Just take a step back and breathe. Look at the bigger picture and recalibrate. Focus on God and have a conversation with him. Read the bible, listen to God's word.
