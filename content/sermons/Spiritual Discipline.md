series:  Silence and Solitude

verse: Mark 6:30-32

The world is fast, we prioritize speed and efficiency. 

If we don't take time to recognize God and feel his presence, life and time will slip right past you.

We need moments to absorb and reflect what we're going through in order to avoid the effect of missing what is happening or recognizing what you've been through.

### Christ calls to calm
Mark 6:30-32
Take a break. Reset yourself
Intentionally seek God and retreat. Spend tome with God.
### Secret Solitude
Mark 1:35
Enjoy solitude with God and unwind
Wake up early and just spend time with God. 
### Pause Purposefully
A lot of people look at social media or watch netflix to rest. 
But it actually does the opposite. It's just an escape. 
>"How do we reenergize ourselves and have meaningful rest?"

Focus on God and have a conversarion with him. Read the bible, listen to God's word. 

Matthew 11:28-29
- As distracting as the world can seem to me, God will gently guide us will give us rest.
Psalm 62:1-2
