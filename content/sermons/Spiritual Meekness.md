verse: Matthew 5:5

What does it mean to be meek?
1. Biblical definition: Not weakness, but strength under control. Submissive but strong. 
2. Easily imposed on
3. Humble, slow to anger

Meekness is a difficult quality to achieve.
Itâ€™s similar to stoicism. Not defensive or confrontational. 

you need to find your satisfaction in being a child of God.

You are already meek or capable of it as a person that has accepted Jesus has your Lord and Savior.
