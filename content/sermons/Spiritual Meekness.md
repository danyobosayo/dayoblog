## What does it mean to be meek? 
1. Biblical definition: Not weakness, but strength under control. Submissive but strong. Humble and slow to anger.
2. English defintion: Easily imposed on
Meekness is a difficult quality to achieve.
It’s similar to stoicism. Not defensive or confrontational. To not take offense when people attack our character (whether purposefully or not).

The best way to combat these situations is to base your confidence and satisfaction in being a child of God. When we strongly identify with our faith and as children of God, nothing else matters.
## Can I really be a meek?
You are immediately capable of it the moment that you truly accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior.
