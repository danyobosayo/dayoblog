#### verse: James 3:1-12 
## Main Idea:
There is an under valued importance of words and our tongue. Words are incredibly powerful and can have a lasting impact.
No matter how good a person might be, our natural tendency is to speak evil than good. 
## Why are words so powerful? 
- Verse 6
- Words penetrate both the hearer and the speaker. 
- Words can destroy a life because of its lasting impact. 
- When someone curses someone, their words will sometimes turn into action. 
- When people bless you with their tongues, they often also bless you with their actions.
#### What do words reveal about ourselves? 
Whatever comes out of your mouth comes from the heart. It reveals who we truly are and alter the way we perceive the world. If we often speak with negative criticisms, then we will continue to perceive the world in such a light.
#### How can we transform our tongues to heal not only others but also ourselves? 
We can't do it on your own. Just because we try to follow a list of rules, doesn't mean we would abide by it. This is why we need a change of heart that can only occur through our faithfulness. If we continuously hear God's loving words, we can equip ourselves to do the same unto others. And we should never forget, we must praise God with our words. It should be our goal to become comfortable with using our words for God, his purpose, and his kingdom.
