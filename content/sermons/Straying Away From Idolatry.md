verse: Exodus 32:1 The golden calf idol

There must only be God in our hearts when we desire to worship the Lord. There shouldn't be any ulterior motive or something that takes precedence such as friends or the pastor. 

The israelites struggled with faith in the Lord because they couldn't *see* him. While Moses was gone, they couldn't bear to patiently wait and instead created their own God.

People often forget the content and information of the sermon's from just the past sunday. Think about how many sermons you've forgotten in your lifetime.

God's seat in our hearts should only be filled with God. Nobody else. 

Do not serve our God as if he were an idol. 

We can try to do everything for God such as worshipping him tirelessly, praying fervently, reading the bible, etc. 
But be careful that God is not an idol. 

What is this key difference? 

God is not your genie. You cannot just depend on him to give you everything that you want. 

Exodus 32:1-14 shows how God is relatable to us. He is a jealous but righteous God who was angry at the Israelites but accepted Moses' pleas.
