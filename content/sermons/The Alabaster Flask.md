verse: Mark 14:1-11
- In this verse we find a woman who pours an alabaster flask which is worth a year's wage and dumps it on Jesus. It's an expressive act that emphasizes her love for Jesus Christ. This in juxtoposition to Judas betraying Jesus for mere dollars demonstrates how being faithful to Christ will *cost* us in a *worldly* sense, and *rejecting* God will barely provide benefit to us in the worldy sense.

Jesus was sinless and lived a perfect life. Yet he lives in a sinless broken world, so how can we act accordingly and similarly to him. 
In other words, what does God want from his people?
Well obviously obedience, but what does that look like? 
> "Extravagant sacrifice. To suffer and experience hardship for His glory."

Why did the people want to crucify Jesus so badly?
- They wanted to continue living indulgent lives that benefited themselves.
Why was this woman able to even perform this act?
- Because she has an immense love and devotion to Jesus Christ.

**Question: What's your alabaster flask?**
- In other words, what do we have available to sacrifice to God, but choose not to.
- Personally, it's my career. I had many opportunities to sacrifice a better pay or job to do ministral work, but decided against it. I pray for a change of heart that I may be impactful at my workplace and share the gospel without fear.
