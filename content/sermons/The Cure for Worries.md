series: Acting in grace together

verse: James 4:13-17
Do not be arrogant. Don't boast about tomorrow. Don't talk about doing this or that, just do it. Whatever God wills you to do, just take action. 

We often become so worried and stressed when things don't go as we plan. How can we deal with this?



What causes worries?
- **Forgetting God in our daily lives.**
- Planning without God in mind. The most prevalent and common sin. Whne we forget God in the daily operation of our life, we assume the role of God in ourselves. 
- "I know whats going to happent tomorrow". This leads to an expectation of a certain reality that may not come true.
- WE DONT KNOW WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING. 
- Leave it all in the hands of God.
- When plans go well we feel superior, and when they dont we feel inferior.

What is the cure?
- When we put God into our daily picture and say "Lord I don't know, help me"
	- You will still have anxiety and worries, but it won't be destructive. 
	- We would be disappointed in how things turn out, but we won't fight internally with ourselves. 
	- "If the Lord wills, we will live"
- **Every moment we are breathing is the grace of God.** 
- We don't deserve life. We've done so many things that have destroyed our relationship with God. 
- God is not going to lead you to do anything. You can't say "God is lesding me to do ..." or "If God wills it..." or "Lord willing..."
	- This means you are blocking your own responsibility, and also undermining the other person's sense of purpose. 
	- Instead, look at your life, it is by God's grace that we are alive, that he has led me to all these places. 
- Appreciate everything that we have and attribute it to God. God is the source behind all of the good things in our life. Thank you for the safe drive home, thank you for the amazing work that I've done today. We can truly rely on God and be thankful. 

What is the role of community?
- Without a community, we can't remember the truth that our lives are because of God's grace. 
- No human on Earth is holy. We don't pray in every moment, we skip reading the bible,etc.
- Surround yourself with fellow stewards that will serve as reminders for this truth. 
- May you continuously feel the blessings from God to empower you to be a blessing onto others.
