#### series: Acting in grace together 
#### verse: James 4:13-17 
## Main Idea:
Do not be arrogant. Don't boast about tomorrow. Don't talk about doing this or that, just do it. Whatever God wills you to do, just take action. 

We often become so worried and stressed when things don't go as we plan. How can we deal with this?
## What causes worries? 
**Forgetting God in our daily lives.**
Contrary to what initially comes to mind for most people, planning without God in mind is the most **prevalent and common sin**. When we forget God in the daily operation of our life, we assume the role of God in ourselves. 
> "I know whats going to happen tomorrow". 

This leads to an expectation of a certain reality that may not come true. This means that innocently *hoping* for a certain outcome can also danger our relationship with God.
At the end of the day, we do **not know** what tomorrow will bring. So we should leave it all in the hands of God.
When plans go well we feel superior, and when they dont we feel inferior. And the unfortunate reality of this cycle is that when things inevitably go bad, we put all of the burden on ourselves.
## What is the cure? 
When we put God into our daily picture and say "Lord I don't know, help me"
- You will still have anxiety and worries, but it won't be destructive. 
- We would be disappointed in how things turn out, but we won't fight internally with ourselves. 
- "If the Lord wills, we will live"

**Every moment we are breathing is the grace of God.**  
- We don't deserve life. We've done so many things that have destroyed our relationship with God. 
- Be warned that God is **not going to lead** you to do anything. You can't say "God is leading me to do ..." or "If God wills it..." or "Lord willing..."
	- This means you are blocking your own responsibility, and also undermining the other person's sense of purpose, especially when you involve a third party.
		- Ex: "God is leading me to make sure that you do not go on this trip"
	- Instead, try to look at your life through His lens. It is only by God's grace that we are alive, that he has led us to all these places. 
- Appreciate everything that we have and attribute it to God. God is the source behind all of the good things in our life. Ex: Thank you for the safe drive home & Thank you for the amazing work that I've done today. We can truly rely on God and be thankful. 
## What is the role of community? 
- Without a community, we can't remember the truth that our lives are because of God's grace. 
- No human on Earth is holy. We don't pray in every moment, we skip reading the bible,etc.
- Surround yourself with fellow stewards that will serve as reminders and encouragements for this truth. 
- May you continuously feel the blessings from God to empower you to be a blessing onto others.
