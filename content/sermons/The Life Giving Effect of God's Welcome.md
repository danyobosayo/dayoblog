#### series: An inviting God 
#### verse: Genesis 2:16-17 
## Main Idea: 
Human souls were not made to bear outcomes. We are not in control of the way things turn out. But God does. 

The Garden of Eden was a place of abundance. But contrary to popular belief, this story isn't about restriction and limitation and rules. God asks us to care for and maintain this beautiful orchard. And likewise, weare also tasked to take part of our own responsibilities, and also enjoy the fruit. God invites us to eat until we cant anymore. This center tree is also good but we are just not ready. What this story really tells us is that, though we may be able to decide on our own, we must first look towards what God desires from us. We shouldn't **lead** and take responsibility for our selves, because it is then that we become mistaken and hurt.
