#### verse: Luke 1:26-56 
## Main Idea:
The meaning of **Christmas**:
1. It's the day that God showed us mercy.
2. And it's also the day that God showed his faithfulness

### An important detail to recognize: 
Mary was afraid and felt inferior. But God empowered her saying that she is a child of God and to stand firm on your two feet. 

For more context: During this time, the Israelites have been enslaved. Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, and now Rome. The Isralites were generally  proud and were persistent in their faith that everything will be okay. But Rome was an iron fist and some people had grown doubtful over their situation. But despite this, Mary remained confident and firm in her belief in God.

The bible is the book of the covenant. It's filled with **promises** made by *God to us*. The old testament has promises that are fulfilled in the new testament. Our faith is placed in the book that the **promise of our salvation was and is fulfilled**.
