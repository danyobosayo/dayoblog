The meaning of christmas:
1. The day that God showed us mercy.
2. A day that God showed his faithfulness

An important detail to recognize:
Mary was afraid and felt inferior. But God empowered her saying that she is a child of God and to stand firm on your two feet. 

For more context at this time for Israelites. They have been enslaved for generations. Egypt, assyria, Babylon, and now Rome. They were always proud and were persistent in their faith that everything will be okay. But Rome was an iron fist and people had some doubt over their situation. 

The bible is the book of the covenant. It's filled with promises made by God to us. The old testament has promises that are fulfilled in the new testament. Our faith is placed in the book that the promise of our salvation will be fulfilled
