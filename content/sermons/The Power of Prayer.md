#### verse: 1 James 5:13-18
## What does prayer do? 
The purpose of prayer is to bring healing from suffering. James 5:13 says that **if you or anyone you know is ever in suffering, we should pray**. Circumstantial, financial, psycholigcal, spiritual, any type of suffering.
We should also **pray when cheerful**. Praise God for the glory he deserves. Active, vocal praise because we are joyful. Sometimes we may feel too tired or feeble to pray. That's why you **need people to pray for you**. 
> Try to pray for yourself, but in those moments you can't. *Have others do it for you*.

It's a biblical matter to pray for each other. You draw closer to God when you pray. You are restored spiritually. Darkness is lit with the light of Jesus Christ. We should also confess our sins to one another. As you do so, pray for one another, it restores broken relationship within each other and also with God.
## Where does the power of prayer come from? 
Comes from the **one who receives it**, not from the one praying. The prayer of a righteous person has greater power, but don't confuse this with holiness.What this means is that **prayer is worthless** if you haven't placed your faith in Jesus. Christians are clothed in the righteousness of Christ.
## How should we pray 
Fervently because we are people, and it is natural for us to wander, stumble, and fall into sinful desires. We must seek prayer for ourselves and others.
## Call to action
Be intentional with prayer
Reach out to others and pray for them, even if *they* think they don't need it because in reality we always need to be prayed for.
