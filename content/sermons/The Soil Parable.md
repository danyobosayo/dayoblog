verse: Mark 4:1-34
Parable of the 4 seeds. Jesus preaching to a big group.

Jesus is trying to teach his disciples: "The sower sows the Word". The truth be spread and shared to many people.

We are all types of soil, one of four
1. Hear the truth but it has zero impact on them
2. Rocky Soil - hear it but doesnt receive it
	Thorns - getting distracted with other desires and things.
3. XX
4. XX
