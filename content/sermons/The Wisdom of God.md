## Main Idea:
Recognize that we are **NEVER** in control of our lives, no matter how much we want to believe otherwise. Ask yourself this: Where do you place our trust in today? Ourselves, our pride?
## What is wisdom? 
God's insight for the *best* way to live. The book of Daniel shows this when God reveals the mystery when no person of flesh could. We need discernment and insight into how God is working in our lives. Recognize that God is in control **not us**.
> How should we respond in times of desparation?
> We should *seek* God and his Godly wisdom
## Why do we need wisdom? 
Worldly/human wisdom **cannot solve life's greatest challenges or mysteries**. No matter what technology and knowledge you may have, it's not enough. The most impossible feats are only possible through God and his wisdom.
## How do we obtain wisdom? 
Notice how Daniel goes to find his closest friends. He asks them to go to the Lord and pray. Approach God and seek his wisdom. Do everything you can to **understand the situation through a lens of faith**. Practice spiritual discipline such as: fasting, waking up early, being mindful of the presence of God. Constantly yearn and desire for God like it's a matter of life or death.
After the miracle of Jesus's ressurection, and the providence of the Word of God, we **no longer have a need for visions**. Our wisdom can be derived directly from the the Word and our relationship with God. When you look at the world through this lens of Faith, you will be able to **recognize how God is using these things for his plan**. Do not worry or be afraid. Trust in God and have faith in Jesus Christ. Daniel's immediate response in times of trouble is to go to God and praise the Lord. Prayer is how we become **intimate with Jesus Christ**, which is why ***Satan tries so earnestly to stop us from praying***. Prayer will change us. Deepen our relationship with God. Praying together shares a united purpose and builds a sense of community and solidarity. We all desperately need God, and by praying in a group, it could lead to a spiritual breakthrough that we cannot even fathom as we pray for one another and ourselves.
