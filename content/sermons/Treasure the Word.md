#### series: Psalm for suffering 
#### verse: Psalm 119 
the longest verse in the bible. It's the written account of David and his devout faith. 
## Main Idea:
People want to make the "best" choice for themselves such as "what should we eat?". But this created stress in our lives. But what's a decision that we can **never** forget. It brings joy, peace, stability. 
## How should Christian's live a holy life based on the Word?
1. Find delight in the word
2. Dedictate your life to the word
3. Look to the hopeful future and be present in the moment.
The bottom line really is to simply **treasure the word of God**.
## Can I treasure God when I don't treasure the Word?
I mean honestly I would find that pretty difficult. Therefore it is essential that we constantly meditate on the Word of God. Treasuring the word, following the commandments, will help you to make the right decisions and run away from sin. 
## Why is it so difficult to treasure the Word?
Today's societal climate makes reading in general, but also specifically the bible, an immense struggle. We are so immersed in a culture of instant gratification. I really have to immerse myself in the word of God and absorb and be mindful of it. This is where we should derive our joy. 

>The commandments aren't rules that prohibit us from doing things. It gives us a blueprint of leading a life of joy, comfort? and stability.
