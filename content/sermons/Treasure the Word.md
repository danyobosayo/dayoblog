series: Psalm for suffering

verse: Psalm 119
the longest verse in the bible. It's the written account of David and his devout faith. 

People want to make the "best" choice for themselves such as "what should we eat?". But this created stress in our lives. But what's a decision that we can **never** forget. It brings joy, peace, stability. 

1. Find delight in the word
2. Dedictate your life to the word
3. Look to the hopeful future and be present in the loment.
Bottom line is to treasure the word of God.
How can you treasure God when yoy don't treasure the word? Treasuring the word, following the commandments, will help you to make the right decisions and run away from sin. 

Today's societal climate makes reading in general, and also specifically the bible, a great struggle. We are so immersed in a culture of instant gratification. I really have to immerse myself in the word of God and absorb and be mindful of it. This is where we should derive our joy. 

The commandments aren't rules that prohibit us from doing things. It gives us a blueprint of leading a life of joy, comfort? and stability. 

Don't forget to ask God to open our eyes to see the wonders of his word.
