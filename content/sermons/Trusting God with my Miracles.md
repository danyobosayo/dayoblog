verse: 
## What is Easter about?
It's not about our kids. Not about the bunny, candy, festivities, or whatever. Yeah it's exciting, but that's to make it memorable for the young ones. As you get older, you'll begin to understand the true meaning of Easter which is the resurrection of our savior and creator and Lord Jesus Christ. 
## How we know Jesus not only walked the Earth, but is truly our savior?
Jesus fulfilling the prophecies foretold in the old testament had criminally low odds. Insurmountably low. 500 witness accounts of Jesus rising from the dead. Half brother James believed even tho he doubted his whole childhood. The 12 disciples died because they believed. There is definitive evidence that Jesus existed. And there is beyond a reasonable doubt that he defeated death.

## The gospel message
For all have sinned and fall short. We're all sinners, broken, disgusting people.
And we are all destined for death because of our inherent sin. But God the father loves us so much that he would send his Son in human flesh to live a perfect life. And then to suffer a terrible death to reap the cost of our sins, freeing us and allowing us to know God and have a relationship with him and also have salvation for eternal life. Nothing else in this life matters other than our amazing all powerful God that simply wants a relationship with us.
## God sometimes asks us to do the opposite of what we think is correct
For ex: "I want to be great", then God will reply, "Then surrender everything and be a servant".
"I want to be first", "then you gotta be last".
"I want revenge", "Then love on them"
It's not supposed to make sense in the secular/logical viewpoint. 
The only thing God wants is a relationship and our obedience.
