#### verse: 1 Samuel 14:1-15 
In the verse, we find a character named Jonathan who was courageous because of his unwaivering faith in God. But there is another character, the nameless armor bearer. He was a key factor in Jonathan's success.
## Main idea:
The **unsung hero** is someone who receives little attention but has contributed much to the success of a team. Park Jisung is a good example of a player on Manchester United that humbly assists others.
Everyone has a desire to be recognized for their good work.

## Who is the hero?
The hero is obviously Jonathan
Context: Israelites are constantly in conflict with neighbors, in this case the phillistines.
It was a small group of 600 israelites against an army of 36,000 philistines. Not only were they outnumbered, the weaponry comrpised of farm tools and no actual combative equipment. Saul was also afraid and was on the outskirts. 
## Who is the unsung hero?
The armor bearer, who's sole responsi is to carry armor for their leader and act as a bodyguard. He speaks only one line but he was not just carrying items, but also Jonathan's heart. 
Any soldier in their right mind would recognize that the mission that Jonathan is leading is inevitably suicide. 
## What if I don't have time to serve?
Everyone is busy, but it all comes down to **priority and sacrifice**. You *have* to make time God, can't expect it to make time for itself.
