## Main Idea:
Most people have what is called [[Time Anxiety]]. But time is a gift. Hold firmly to God's sovereignty, **trust** in his plan. We need to have the courage to wait beyond time. What does this mean?
## Why is time so valuable?
How we spend our time is often how we **define our identity**. "Faster is better" is an idea that many people in society resonate with. Many of us believe that there is value in speed and efficiency,  but we also often *overvalue* it. [[Time Famine]] is the idea that no matter how hard we try, we **cannot** accomplish everything that we desire. Time is supposed to be a **gift from God** for us to cherish, but it has devolved into something else. 
## What does waiting do to us?
Waiting shifts our identity into people of **holiness** rather than **hopelessness.** A difficult season of waiting is not accidental. There's a purpose for our trials. "Blessed is he who waits". Periods of waiting and idelness allow us to **remove impurities and strife**.  It strengthens our faith in God. The wicked will **respond to waiting with wickedness and strife**. But believers who wait on God actively by keeping their faith will be **rewarded**. 
**DO NOT FEAR**: your job is not to climb a ladder or sprint in a race. It's to wait for God to let you do as you do. 
## How are we to be people that wait beyond time?
Waiting isn't an obstacle, it's not an obstruction. It's an *opportunity* to look forward to and feel excited about because it's a chance for us to show our piety. 
***Remember God's providence and promises*** 
It's not about the circumstance we find ourselves in. It's about who we are and who is behind us, which is God, and he promises us an eternal inheritance.
