verse: Daniel 12:1-13

[[Time Anxiety]] 
But time is a gift. 
Hold firmly to God's sovereignty, trust in his plan. 

We need to have the courage to wait beyond time. What does this mean?

### Why is time so valuable?
- How we spend our time is how we define our identity. 
- "Faster is better" is an idea that many people in society identify themselves with. Many of us believe that there is value in speed and efficiency. 
- [[Time Famine]] is the idea that no matter how hard we try, we **cannot** accomplish everything that we desire. 
- Time is supposed to be a gift from God to Cherish, but it has devolved into something else. 
### What does waiting do to us? The benefit?
- Waiting shifts our identity into people of **holiness** rather than **hopelessness.** 
- A difficult season of waiting is not accidental. There's a purpose for our trials. "Blessed is he who waits"
- Periods of waiting allow us to remove impurities and strife.  It strengthens our faith in God. Actively waiting produces holiness. 
- The wicked will respond to waiting with wickedness and strife. But believers who wait on God actively by keeping their faith will be rewarded. 
- **DO NOT FEAR**: your job is not to climb a ladder or sprint in a race. It's to wait for God to let you do as you do. 
### How are we to be people that wait beyond time?
- Waiting isn't an obstacle, it's not an obstruction. It's an opportunity to look forward to and feel excited about because it's a chance for us to show our piety. 
- *Remember God's providence and promises* 
	- It's not about the circumstance we find ourselves in. It's about who we are and who is behind us, which is God.
	- God promises us an eternal inheritance.
