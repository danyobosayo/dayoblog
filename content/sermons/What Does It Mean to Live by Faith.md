verse: Hebrews 12:1-2

We should inherently be in pursuit of God. We are born to immitate, and we should be immitating that which is perfect, which is God.

We usually follow those around us though. It's not wrong to be influenced by others, but we must follow those **worth following.** 

There should be a goal to reach. Without purpose we cannot find motivation. 

Though we may feel alone, you must know that we are not alone. 

Surround yourself with brothers that will bring you up. Will keep you accountable, that want to see you succeed. 

Jesus, the founder and perfector of our faith should be who we look toward. We can do this by going to the cross.

Don't show off for yourself. God gave you this life to glorify Him.
