#### verse: Hebrews 12:1-2 
## Main Idea:
We should inherently be in pursuit of God. We are born to immitate, and we should be immitating that which is perfect, which is God.

We usually follow those around us though. It's not wrong to be influenced by others, but we must follow those **worth following.** 
Though we may *feel* alone, you must **know** that we are never alone. For one, God is always with us by our side at every step of our journeys. But we should also surround ourselves with people that will bring you up. Brothers and sisters that will keep you accountable, that want to see you succeed. 

Jesus, the founder and perfector of our faith should be who we look toward. We can do this by going to the cross at every turn of our lives. **Don't show off for yourself**. God gave you this life to glorify Him.
