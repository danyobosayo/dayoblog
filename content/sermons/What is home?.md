#### verse: Ephesians 5 
## Main Idea:
What is home? Home is joy, comfort, rest, security, etc. But it can also have conflict, bitterness, frustration, and abuse. Everyone desires a home to be filled with joy... but is this possible?
How do people relate to each other? How do we be more christ like?

## Where should we place Jesus in our lives?
Jesus Christ must be lord in all your relations. family, lover, employer. in everything. Have Christ be the **center** of your relationship. Every aspect in your life is to be grounded in Christ. This is a picture of heaven on Earth, and heaven is our home.
## What is the impact that we have on others?
Being filled with the Holy Spirit, your acceptance of Jesus Christ as lord will **benefit** those around you. They will **observe and recognize** the preciousness of Jesus. You can create a little heaven wherever you go. You can be light to them.
## How do we practically get here? 
Submitting to one another in a reverance for Christ. Give yourself to your wife. To lead your wife to Christ-likeness. Do not command or direct, rather humbly sacrifice. The manliest thing you can do is falling on your knees in prayer to God.
## How does this apply commercially?
Be generous in the way you treat your employees. Be giving. And as an employee, treat your employer with love and kindness. With hard work and christ like action. how can we submit to those above and below us? Seek the fullness of the spirit in your life daily, *actively and intentionally*. Daily seeking and submission to God. Ask God for this fullness, to help us. For God you will do anything to fix your approach of life. **Challenge** yourself in a group of believers. When you are filled, you won't know by emotional ecstasy, but you will want to make melodies for Christ. You will be **thankful for every matter** of your life, even when things are going awry. A heart of thanksgiving for God. You will be thankful that God remains by your side through everything. You will desire and want to submit to others. All because of what Jesus Christ has done for us. 
**This is the life of God we must follow.**
