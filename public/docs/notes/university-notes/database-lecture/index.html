Database
Data
Universe of discourse (mini-world)
Database management system - This software system will do 4 things with the data. Some examples inclued: mySQL, mongoDB, oracle

Define - Know what information you want to store. Know the data types, the structures and also constraints.
Construct - Populate the database with information.
Manipulate - Performing some kind of query on the table to get a result. This could also include changing information and storing it again.

Retreival, modification, accessing


Share


Database system - The entire db system is simply the DMBS + data.




  Database types and applications
  #


There are various data types that a database can store.

In the past it was strictly numbers and strings
But now we can store videos, images.


Some applications include:

A geographic info system


For a database to be useable, we need three things:

Mini-world
Data is correlated, and what data do we need to show for the user.
Identify for WHOM we are storing the data.


Catalog

Stores the description of a particular databse, e.g. data structures, types, and constraints
Also known as meta-data





  Example mini-world exercise:
  #

Online car resale database:
MODELs are of CAR BRANDs
MODELs have YEARs
CAR_ID have MODEL and YEARs and AVAILIBILITY
CAR_SELLERs sell CAR BRANDs
PEOPLE buy CAR_IDs
PEOPLE are interested in CAR_IDS

<a class=anchor href=#data-model>#</a></h3><p>Related to data abstraction, hiding the process of data retrieval from the user.
This model will describe the structure of the DB, the operations for manipulating and changing the structures, and the constraints that the DB would obey.
<strong>Constructs</strong> define the database structure</p><ul><li>They typically are comprised of elements (data and their types), groups, and relationships
<strong>Operations</strong> are the functions that we call to obtain or update the information regarding the construct of the data model.</li><li>Basic model operations include: insert, delete, update</li><li>User-defined operations include: computer_student_gpa, update_inventory</li></ul><h3 id=categories-of-data-models>Categories of Data Models

Physical (low-level, internal):</li><li>Provide concepts that describe details of how data is stored in the computer.<ul><li>Such as the data type, number of bytes, the index structure, etc.
Implementation (representational):</li></ul></li><li>Sort of a middle ground, not too much detail of the physical storage, and also conceptually understandable.
Self-describing:</li><li>Combines the description of data with its values.<ul><li>Such as XML, key-value stores, and some NOSQL systems.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=schema-intension>Schema (intension)
<a class=anchor href=#schema-intension>#</a></h3><p>Database Schema - the description of the database (just the structure)</p><ul><li>Includes descriptions of the structure, data types, and the constraints.<ul><li>But most importantly, not the actual data.</li></ul></li><li>The primary key is the particular column of a data table that provides identifiying information. This is used to with other tables to map relationships.</li></ul><h3 id=state-extension>State (extension)
<a class=anchor href=#state-extension>#</a></h3><p>At this point of time, what is the current status of the database?</p><ul><li>Ex: At 12:13pm, STUDENT table has 2 records, COURSE has 4 records, etc.
Essentially a snapshot of the database (including the content) at a given type.
Every state should be valid, if any change is invalid, then the state is not saved.</li></ul><h3 id=three-schema-architecture>Three-Schema Architecture
<a class=anchor href=#three-schema-architecture>#</a></h3><p>The main characteristics of a database such as self-describing, program-data independence, and concurrency is achieved through this architecture type
The goal of Three-Schema is to separate user applicatoins from the physical storage</p><h5 id=the-three-levels-of-schema>The three levels of schema:
<a class=anchor href=#the-three-levels-of-schema>#</a></h5><ul><li>Internal Schema - describes the physical storage structure and access paths (indexes)<ul><li>Uses a physical model</li></ul></li><li>Conceptual schema - describe the structure using datatypes, relationships, and user operations, as well as constraints for the entire databases<ul><li>Uses a conceptual or an implementation data model.</li></ul></li><li>External Schema - Various user views for different types of users. ?????? look into this<ul><li>Typically uses the same data model as the conceptual</li></ul></li></ul><h5 id=mapping>Mapping
<a class=anchor href=#mapping>#</a></h5><p>Basically what is the relationship of the external view to the conceptual schema to the internal schema so that we can effectively obtain the proper information and display it accurately to the user.

This only works for <strong>total and disjoint</strong> relations. Note that you will see the total relation from the super to the (d) thing, not from (d) to the subclasses. This should make sense to you mug.</li><li>Basically, this variation allows us to not have to write any superclass relation, but all of our subclasses will show the attributes of its superclass.</li><li>The reason why it has to be total is: say we have a superclass vehicle and two subclasses car and truck. If we don&rsquo;t have total participation, we will <strong>lose</strong> information of the superclass (Vehicle_id, license_plate_no) when it classifies as a subclass. Loss of data.</li><li>The reason it has to be disjoint is because if it was overlapping, we could have a single vehicle entity identify itself as both a car and a truck. We would then have the same information represented twice and this would be a duplication. Duplication of data.</li></ul></li><li>8C: Single relation with one type attribute. <strong>Partial disjoint relation</strong><ul><li>This one is good for disjoint subclasses. We are creating a single relation/table, so at that point of time, this single relation will have all of the attributes of its superclass union with all attributes of the subclasses union one type attribute. The type attribute specifies whether it identifies as a certain subclass or not. The discriminatory attributes are going to be the subclass attributes because many of them will be null because the entity can only identify as one subclass.</li></ul></li><li>8D: Single relatoin with multiple type attributes. <strong>Overlapping</strong> subclasses<ul><li>We have a single relation/table with attributes of the superclass, and all of the attributes of the subclasses.

If we have a shared subclass, and we inherit multiple super classes, we would be duplicating the same attributes of the parent.

You get to discern at which point it&rsquo;s too atomic. Hierlogical process because you HAVE to go step by step. For anything to be in the third normal form, it must have first been a first normal and second normal form.<ul><li>First -> We cannot have <strong>composite, multivalued, or nested (complex)</strong> attributes.<ul><li><strong>Solution1</strong>: Create a new relation/table w/ the primary key of the original table, and the single attribute that violates.<ul><li>This is the best solution, the others are not good.</li></ul></li><li>Solution2: For the multi-valued attribute, create more instances of attributes to accomodate for the multiple versions. The issue here is we will have NULL values for other tables.</li><li>Solution3: Pair up each individual attribute value with the primary key. The issue here is the redundancy of information.</li><li>Solution4 (complex): Create two new tables, one that has all of the Non-complex attributes, including the primary key. And then Another table that has ONLY the complex attribute split up, and then also the primary key, whilst making one of the complex attributes that was split into a primary key.</li></ul></li><li>Second -> Every non-prime attribute of a relation should be fully functionally dependent on whole keys, not part of the key.<ul><li><strong>Solution:</strong> Identify which attributes are not fully functionally dependent. We then create new tables that contain only the attribute itself and whatever primary key is requires. Essentially, if we have 3 relations of dependencies, we will need 3 separate tables for each level of dependency.</li></ul></li><li>Third -> The non-prime attribute should not depend on another non-prime attribute. There should not be a transitive dependency.</li><li>BCNF -> Rare but possible.</li><li>Fourth -> Super rare</li></ul></li><li>Normalization<ul><li>Functional Dependency (FD) -> Specifies relation between different <strong>attributes</strong>. And that relationship becomes a <strong>constraint</strong> in a relational schema.<ul><li>Good Ex: SSN value <em>determines</em> the value of the Fname, Minit, and Lname. The reason why this is a good example is the <strong>UNIQUENESS</strong> of the output attribute.</li><li>Bad Ex: Department Number determines the value of Department Name. So every time Dnumber = 5, Dname = &lsquo;Research&rsquo;. This is poor practice because every Dnumber of 5 will have a Dname of research. Instead of a functional dependency, this information should instead be stored as a base relation. This is because X is not a PRIMARY KEY.</li></ul></li><li>Key -> A minimal super key. The smallest combination of attributes that can provide uniqueness.<ul><li>Super key -> Any combination of attributes that can provide uniqueness.</li><li>Candidate Key -> When you have multiple unique identifiers, these are all considered candidate keys. We can arbitrarily assign one of them as the Primary Key, and everything else is a secondary Key.</li></ul></li><li>Prime Attribute -> Attribute that is a member of a candidate key. <strong>Careful with composite keys</strong>, each of their attributes are prime.</li><li>Non Prime Attribute -> Attribute that is NOT a member of a candidate key. Basically it is not uniquely identifying.</li><li>Full Functional Dependecy (second form) (FD) -> Specifies a relationship Y -> Z, where any key attribute lost in Y will break the dependency.</li><li>Transitive Dependency (third form) -> Suppose we have an FD x -> z. it can be drived from x->y and y->z</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=ch-30---database-security>Ch. 30 - Database Security

If there is one specific record we are looking for, we need to search on average b/2 disk blocks. If that record does <strong>not</strong> exist, then we must read all <strong>b</strong> disk blocks.</li><li><strong>Update</strong> -> Find the record, copy the information into the buffer, modify the information, and put it back into the same spot.</li><li><strong>Delete</strong> -> Find all records that satisfy the condition (Might need to go through all blocks). Copy the information into the buffer, delete from the buffer, and rewrite it to the disk. The <strong>disadvantage</strong> of this is the remaining unused record space. A solution for this is creating a new field/attribute called the <strong>deletion marker</strong>. This is simply a boolean indicator of whether or not the attribute is supposed to be removed or not. The problem still remains that we have unused space, and at a certain point we need to rearrange or storage.</li></ul><h3 id=ordered-file>Ordered File

The primary difference is the existence of duplicate ordering field values. This means that when we look for a specific record, we need to look <strong>within</strong> non-unique key values.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Search</strong> -> <code>SELECT * FROM student WHERE id = 3;</code> This example uses the <strong>ordering field</strong> for searching. This means that the record reading is <em>extremely efficient,</em> especially if we use <strong>binary search</strong>.<ul><li><strong>Search but not good</strong> -> <code>SELECT * FROM student WHERE state = 'NY';</code> This is an example of how we might be using an <strong>ordered file</strong> structure, but not reaping any benefit because we are searching based on a <strong>non-ordering field</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Insert</strong> -> Expensive operation.<ul><li>One option is to Initially keep buffer spaces in between each block to account for new records. But the issue will arise once the space is used.</li><li>Another option is to use an overflow file. Requires periodical reorganization. For the overflow file itself, insertion becomes easier, but then searching becomes difficult again.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Delete</strong> -> We can again use a deletion marker.
