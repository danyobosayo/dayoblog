  Modern Software Engineering (8/20)
  #


What is the point of software engineering? What does it fix?

The problem with software development in the past:

Late
Too expensive
Poor quality
And less functional than promised.




The internet was first born in the early 1970s.
Mid 1990s, the web came ot be.



  Modern Software Engineering (8/22)
  #


Waterfall life cycle model is evil, much worse than agile methodology.

It was the method used for centuries before technology existed.


What is the fundamental problem with building projects?

Poor project management
Do not use good engineering practices.

Example: waterfall methodology

The waterfall methodology is popular, but this life cycle model doesn&rsquo;t work because of one key issue, that the requirements KEEP CHANGING. Waterfall assumes that the requirements don&rsquo;t change.






project efficiency - described as a project being on time and within budget.
A low failure rate of software projects is not a direct indication of success or product quality.

If only 1% of projects fail, it may indicate that not enough risks are being taken.
Multicore is usually better for performance, but there are edge cases where this is not the case.


In situations like these, it&rsquo;s better to go back to singlecore and use rate monotonic analysis.
Be careful with the decisions you make especially when trying to prioritize speed.

It is not worth it to deliver poor quality work at the price of speed.

  What is devops
  #


Getting the users involved with the developer team to find what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.


  How to avoid the typical mistakes:
  #


Identify problems that have occured in previous projects that have a similar goal to your project.
Discuss major mistakes that were made with other people, whether coworkers in different departments, or even friends in the industry.
Create a checklist of mistakes to be mindful of. Hopefully they don&rsquo;t get checked off
Create a list of mistakes to AVOID during planning and monitor cautiously.
Create a watchdog, an alarm so to speak, to sound whenever your proect starts leaning toward a mistake.


  Essential vs Accidental Complexity

Any project has a certain aspect of essential complexity, it is just intrinsic to the stuff that we do."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/docs/notes/university-notes/swe-lecture/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:description" content="Modern Software Engineering (8/20) # What is the point of software engineering?

To combat this, engineers created radars and scanners to detect when the plane is in danger, but it was an optional feature that many engineers did not opt to install because it cost extra. This meant that there was only one point of failure. Furthermore, there was new software that would take control of the plane to correct its sterring, but this feature was not known to many pilots, causing major panic in those situations to the pilots that did not understand why they could not fly their plane.</li><li>Bob Martin&rsquo;s lessons learned:<ul><li>When our mistakes may cause injury, loss, or death, it is up to us to ensure the upmost safety.</li></ul></li></ul><h5 id=healthcaregov>Healthcare.gov
