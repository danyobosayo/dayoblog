I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site # Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start.

It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme # Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically. The Home Page # Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static # Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle # When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage # The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created.

That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\nrange .Title end The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File # $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Not just a boastful nature, but a spiritual pride.\nDo we have spiritual pride?\nSpiritual pride leaves to an obsession with control. Nebechadnezzar thinks that the fruits of his labor all came by his own doing. Spiritual restoration occured when he let go of his control and gave all glory to God most high.\nWhen we have the courage release our control and pride to God, then we actually experience such great complete peace. Not just temporarily, but eternally. Letting go isn\u0026rsquo;t losing something, it\u0026rsquo;s allowing God to lead our lives.\nHow can we become courageous to lose control? You have to look up and toward God and recognize his greatness, and our lowliness. Understand that he is WORTHY of our devotion. Allow our struggles to ignite our hearts and humble ourselves. When we go through hardship, we need to understand that we never even deserved to live. So we should be joyous as we go through difficulties.\nControl will kill our joy and peace in any situation (good or bad). Look at Daniel 4 where the king is content and at ease because his kingdom was prosperous. His life was flourishing, and yet in verse 5 he quickly became afraid because of a dream. His joy and peace was incomplete. So as easily as he can obtain prosperity, he can lose it. The natural order of life is becoming anxious. Because when we are up, we are anxious to stay up. And when we\u0026rsquo;re down, we arr anxious to get up. The king places his identity within his own glory and prosperity. So the thought of losing it has completely taken over his mental state. Having a heart of humility id knowing that we don\u0026rsquo;t deserve anything. We have to admit that we are prideful and recognize how everything in this life is a gift. Every breath we take, every bite of food. We depend on God for everything. We feel powerless when we lose the very thing we thought we could control. The best example of this id our own lives. We assume we get to live and control our own lives, but the irony is that we become more controlled and powerful by giving it all to god. When we look for relationships that glorify ourselves we are prideful and sinning. Pride makes us look for people to match our needs, rather than us matching other\u0026rsquo;s needs. Community groups do not exist to meet your needs. It\u0026rsquo;s to meet the needs of other people. God honors those who honor him. Proper worship is one way to honor God. Worship is not about us, it\u0026rsquo;s about God. Practicing proper worship helps us to get back on track. It will fuel courage to lose control. Come to Church as a servant, and not just as a consumer. Participate, be active and involved.

It\u0026rsquo;s an expressive act that emphasizes her love for Jesus Christ. This in juxtoposition to Judas betraying Jesus for mere dollars demonstrates how being faithful to Christ will cost us in a worldly sense, and rejecting God will barely provide benefit to us in the worldy sense. Jesus was sinless and lived a perfect life. Yet he lives in a sinless broken world, so how can we act accordingly and similarly to him. In other words, what does God want from his people? Well obviously obedience, but what does that look like?\n\u0026ldquo;Extravagant sacrifice.

In this set of verses, Moses finds an eternally burning bush. Note that we can easily consider this a miracle, however it is also not so easily observed. Main Idea # There are moments when we go to God asking for something we desire or feel like we need. But sometimes God answers us by making life more difficult/troublesome. There are often things that we don\u0026rsquo;t realize need to be addressed until God tells us they need to be fixed.\nWhat is a divine disruption? # A quiet invitation, hidden in an ordinary interuption God often reveals himself in a quiet and gentle fashion. But why isn\u0026rsquo;t he so extravagant/flashy? Because God desires our genuine attention. Just like he doesn\u0026rsquo;t force us to love or believe in him, he also reveals himself in subtle ways to train ourselves to recognize his character. Idea: There\u0026rsquo;s burning bushes all around us, but we miss them. # It\u0026rsquo;s not a question of whether or not God is there, but a matter of us noticing how he\u0026rsquo;s working in our lives. Humans have a tendency for comfort, and regularity. We want to accomplish our own agenda. However these burning bushes will often cause you to change course to fulfill God\u0026rsquo;s agenda. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of these burning bushes? # To gain a better understanding of who God is. God calls us not to be stuck on this world, but to be saved by his Son. We are people who are born again with a new purpose. How do we recognize divine disruption? # If we look at verse 3, we notice that Moses had to turn aside in order to confront the burning bush. Note that the burning bush didn\u0026rsquo;t call out to Moses or get his attention. Moses noticed the bush by his own accord. Thus we must step out of our routine, out of our comfort in order to look towards God. Really look for the ways he\u0026rsquo;s working in your life. We are the problem, and the only thing we need to change is ourselves. Call to action # Stop moving so quickly and just pause. Turn towards God and listen for him. It will help us to see and understand that our purpose isn\u0026rsquo;t to just live in this world, but that God has called us for a greater purpose for his plan and for his glory.

His mother hid him in the reeds and the Phaoroh\u0026rsquo;s daughter decides to spare his life. She names him Moses because she, \u0026ldquo;Drew him out of the water\u0026rdquo; Admist a chaos for the Israelites, the mother of Moses sees it differently. Instead of fearing for her child\u0026rsquo;s life, she instead has a vision similar to God\u0026rsquo;s. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the mother deems her son as, \u0026ldquo;Fine\u0026rdquo; or in Hebrew, \u0026ldquo;Tov\u0026rdquo;. Which directly translates to Good. This echos the ideas from Genesis 1, where God found things Good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t about the child\u0026rsquo;s physical appearance. It was about his character and she found it good. Obviously as humans, we have a tendency to react things in a worldly manner. But how much more joyful and at peace could we be if we saw things the way God sees it?\nHow can I describe God?\nHe remembers He\u0026rsquo;s not distant at all, rather he draws near to us. He is a moving God that is constantly working within our lives. Goal: See as God sees by recognizing his perspective more often. \u0026ldquo;Train your eye\u0026rdquo;\nGod sees goodness where others see a problem # News Flash: We care more about how we think about ourselves more than we value other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions. Your biggest criticizor is yourself because you know yourself better than anyone. You can either spend your life trying to make yourself ideal in the eyes of society, or be content in the lens of God. Not through the lens of performance, money, physical appearance, but through the lens of God\u0026rsquo;s purposes. God sees redemption when we see ruin # The mother tries to keep her child hidden away and protected from the searches for 3 months. But when she couldn\u0026rsquo;t bear it any longer, God takes over. But why does God wait this long, let the mother suffer with the turmoils and stress of hiding a baby? God waits for us to deplete our options because he desires full trust and surrender in him, not just a partial commitment. God is the only hope\u0026hellip; the only answer. God is capable of all things. Consider your suffering a joy, because in the midst of your problems, you can see how God is keeping his covenant and his faithfulness. Focus on the redemption, not the ruin God sees his purpose unfolding in the people we least expect # In the passage we see the Pharoh\u0026rsquo;s daughter as a central figure in Moses\u0026rsquo; story. Nobody could expect her to spare Moses\u0026rsquo; life because she is a direct descendant of the government that is trying to kill all baby Israelites. God is not the God who we think he is. God has a purpose beyond what we can comprehend. But how then can we trust in God or see how he sees things? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it far too difficult? Surround yourself in the Word, in his people, and in his presence. How can I take action and see as God sees the world? # If you look at the life of Jesus, he lived a life of complete suffering. It was about service, and stewardship. He was mocked, scorned, and cruficied. The Son of God, the Son of Man. LOOK AT THE CROSS No matter the circumstance, see it as God sees it. In our time of suffering, chaos, and uncertainty. God has not forgotten you, rather he has a plan for you.

Rather hardship, suffering, oppression. But you will see that God is still deeply in work.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy is God silent sometimes? # To give us hope to something greater. Contextually, the Israelites have experienced an absence of God for roughly 400 years. In verse 1, we see the geneological descendants of Abraham in order to show that God is working on the promises he made back in Genesis. God is always there. And he has a masterful plan. God builds slowly. We see that the people nation of Israel grow to great heights. God has been faithfully helping them multply and grow into a nation. God siliently aided the Israelites. What is God doing during these lulls? # Silence does not equate to God not working with us. He is always with us and constantly watching over us and working within us. He is always holding our hand. Stand firm and abide in Him. There will be worldly things that will try to pull you away from trusting in God. They will rip you apart and tear you to pieces. And God allows these moments too. God continues to stay silent but also continues to work. This is because he cares about us and would rather us grow than bring immediate relief. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not punishment, it\u0026rsquo;s preparation for something better\u0026rdquo;. How should we navigate through these quiet times? # Daily faithfulness but what does this look like? Often it\u0026rsquo;ll feel like, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going nowhere. I\u0026rsquo;m not good enough. I\u0026rsquo;m not producing enough. Where are the results?\u0026rdquo;\nBut just like we don\u0026rsquo;t see God\u0026rsquo;s provisions and how he\u0026rsquo;s working within our lives, we also fail to see how we are working within our own lives. We need to also be mindful of how we mesaure ourselves. You may think that you\u0026rsquo;re stagnant, but you\u0026rsquo;re in fact growing faster than ever before.\nTo combat this, we need to be actively mindful of ourselves. We need to reflect often and see, \u0026ldquo;Where has God been faithful to me?\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not a matter of \u0026ldquo;God working\u0026rdquo;, but rather us \u0026ldquo;Seeing how he is working\u0026rdquo;.\nSo pray often. Talk to God. Be present in the Word of God in order to remind yourself of the presence of God.\nWhen does Godly obedience begin? # When we revere God more than we fear people. We can see this in verse 17 when the Egyptian mid-wives refused to follow the Phraoah\u0026rsquo;s commandment to kill all Hebrew male born babies. Defying the Pharoah\u0026rsquo;s word would result in immediate execution, but they feared God more than man. Having a deeper respect for God\u0026rsquo;s authority, even when it costs us. This obedience is unseen, sacrificial, costly, and just very real. Only God saw these actions. And so God \u0026ldquo;Dealt well with the mid-wives\u0026rdquo;. When we are quietly obeying and being faithful, even when nobody is watching. God will honor our obedience, even when nobody else sees.

Not by conforming to the world, but by confessing our sins to God. If people want to see a revival of the church, it has to start with every individual member. What does a revived church look like? God\u0026rsquo;s glory is revealed through each individual person.\nIntroduction # One issue with Korean/Korean-American churches is the over-emphasis of community. \u0026ldquo;Prosperity Gospel\u0026rdquo; is the theory that as long as you follow Jesus, your life will be easy, fulfilling, prosperous, etc. But the actual teachings of the gospel share a very different idea. The idea that we are all sinners, and that we are condemned to death. But through the grace and death of our Lord Jesus that we are saved. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of division within the christian church today. People are ignoring the word of God for the sake of cultural acceptance. Some churches are now accepting lgbtq, same sex marriage within the clergy, etc. Furthermore, we have the entertainment focused conservative churches that host intense worships that can be considered concerts. These church services have \u0026ldquo;heightened emotions\u0026rdquo;, but a decline in God\u0026rsquo;s word.\nWe can easily face the same issue when we focus community over Christ. And on the individual level, sometimes we prioritize a church where we find a sense of belonging, or a tight knit friendship. And at a certain point, we value our community over the actual service. We need to stop conforming to the world.\nWhat are the signs of a desolate church? # The church\u0026rsquo;s heart and mind are captured by forces that are foreign to God.\nDaniel 9:13 People are following things that are away from God\u0026ndash; from the ways of the world. Israelites are called to live a life of holiness. And they were commanded to do so. But they didn\u0026rsquo;t abide in those rules. They would conform to what the surrounding nations would do because that life was: easier, promised more security, peaceful, and comforting. While under Babylonian rule, they became more and more comfortable with Babylonian culture. On the individual scale, we make terrible choices. We choose to stay awake just a little longer, or immerse ourselves in lust, etc. We often prioritize our own gratification and prosperity, and not following what God has revealed to us. It shows how much we are lacking as believers and followers. Another sign is the church feels Guilt and Shame We feel shame because we lost purpose and identity. We begin to question ourselves, \u0026ldquo;Are we really any different to non-believers?\u0026rdquo; Are you practicing counter-cultural behaviors such as service, loving, sacrifice, discomfort, etc. Is your citizenship truly in heaven? The church has become a byword among others. Byword - Disgrade, object of shame When others observe us, they don\u0026rsquo;t consider us any different. Our Christian identity is merely a title, and not our citizenship. Daniel in the text is confessing that his people have become a byword in the community, and that they are no different to everyone else. Is Salt \u0026amp; Light a desolate church? # In my honest opinion, I think it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to throw everyone under the same umbrella. I think that there are some of us that can be recognized as different from other believers, whereas others aren\u0026rsquo;t. What is the danger/consequences of a desolate church? # We lose God\u0026rsquo;s Protection.\nDaniel 9:17 -\u0026gt; It was God who brought them calamity. He stopped protecting them. The worst judgment that Mankind can possibly experience is being taken away from the presence of God. People lose their sense of purpose. \u0026ldquo;Where do you place your priorities in your free time?\u0026rdquo; We willingly and deliberately shift towards chaos by running away from God How is a desolate church restored? # The confession of Sin\nBut not just confession, but rather convicted confession. Through reading scripture Daniel 9:2 -\u0026gt; It was only by reading through scripture that he understood how important and urgent it was to confess the sins of himself and the church. Jeremiah 12:11 -\u0026gt; Shows how Daniel was convicted by the word of God. When your prayer is saturated by the word of God, then you\u0026rsquo;ll know you\u0026rsquo;re praying the right prayer. Align yourself with God\u0026rsquo;s commandment Be generous Be kind Serve others Lean into discomfort Don\u0026rsquo;t be angry Go towards God. It\u0026rsquo;s not too late. One man\u0026rsquo;s prayer (Daniel\u0026rsquo;s) shed hope to a completely lost nation. As much as God is great and to be feared, He is merciful and forgiving. Recognize this truth and kneel down in reverence to God. God loves us so much, and he forgives us regardless of what we have committed. Conclusion # As a church we need to constantly confess to our brokenness and sinfulness. Cause if we don\u0026rsquo;t, then we will conform to the values and culture of the World. It is only by faith and through the grace and mercy of God that we are saved. Recognize this beautiful opportunity as believers to share His goodness with the world. Saturate our words and our thoughts with scripture Pray that God\u0026rsquo;s will will be done, by members of this church.

Daniel had a terrible vision of this that it brought him illness. But even then, we find that in verse 27 that he rose and \u0026ldquo;went about the king\u0026rsquo;s business\u0026rdquo;. He remains courageously consistent although he was facing overwhelming fear and hardship.\nWhen life is overwhelming and uncertain, how can we also remain courageously consistent just as Daniel was. Because we can\u0026rsquo;t so this by our own power.\nWhy is endurance better than fleeing from difficult times? # Endurance fills us with peace and also frees us from control. If we don\u0026rsquo;t endure but instead we flee by acting rashly or shutting down or compromising our values, we are trying to take our own control of the situation. But when we do this, we lie to ourselves thinking that we will feel better, but this is a temporary solution. It\u0026rsquo;s instant gratification. Example: A family that is comfortable and happy and loving. But dad feels like if they ha djudt a little more money they\u0026rsquo;d be set. An opportunity arises to work abroad and make a lot more money. The family agrees and he makes more. But eventually the family falls apart as the father grows distant and has less of an image. The loneliness of the father leads to an affair and then the entire family is broken. The father didn\u0026rsquo;t endure. He tried to take control of his own destiny???? Wait i don\u0026rsquo;t get it. In hindsight it was a poor decision, but i feel like before that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that rash a decision. What is endurance? # It\u0026rsquo;s not to just \u0026ldquo;suck it up\u0026rdquo; and sit in suffering. Rather it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;ordinary faithfulness for extraordinary purposes\u0026rdquo;. No matter what situation Daniel found himself in, he remained faithful and had daily obedience. Making moves not based on your preference, but rather God\u0026rsquo;s direction. Doing the same mundane things every single day. God uses this ordinary faithfulness to fulfill his will. The principle of consistently doing what is required of us gives everything meaning. Things like keeping the room clean doing your work studying talking to your friends, building relationships Where does Endurance come? # Endurances comes from seeking to understand God\u0026rsquo;s plan. He\u0026rsquo;s seeking to find what God\u0026rsquo;s will is. Through the lens of the gospel truth, our suffering has purpose. God uses hard times to shape us to the image of Christ. Our hope is secured no matter what we face because Jesus has endured and has suffered for our sakes. Choosing to be consistent in our daily matters, is much better than looking for extraordinary options as a solution to our problems.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/sermons/resting-in-the-unknown/","title":"Resting in the Unknown","section":"Sermons","content":"2025-02-16 series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith\nverse: Daniel 7:15-28\nA man receives a direct vision from God.

He doesn\u0026rsquo;t demand understanding, but instead continues to rest in both the unknown and peace. People are generally restless with the unknown. We seek answers at every turn. But finding the answer won\u0026rsquo;t result in peace. Often times the answer isn\u0026rsquo;t clear, thus the increase in knowledge leads to confusion.\nWhy is knowledge alone insufficient to bring peace?\nknowledge can inform the mind but it\u0026rsquo;s not capable of settling the heart. even divine knowledge cannot bring peace. God is always ruling, in control, and omniscient. How do we feel peCe?\nBy trusting in the one that provides us life. Trust in God. How can we respond when clarity hasnt come How can we rest in the unknown? Verse 28, look at how Daniel responds. Daniel kept it to himself and in his heart. Sort of bit his tongue, and didn\u0026rsquo;t act recklessly or freak out. How was he able to rest? Daniel has been seeing a lot of visions recently. Fix your eyes on the cross. On our redeemer. As we deal with uncertainty (no matter what it is), be at rest in knowing that God is in control and he has a plan for us.

The only way to take Daniel down was to attack his devotion to God. \u0026ldquo;For 30 days, let nobody worship anyone buy you. If you break this law they will be thrown into the Lion\u0026rsquo;s den\u0026rdquo; Daniel is being asked to temporarily stop praying for God. Realistically he could reason and say that this is just a small break. But no, he could not compromise this value. Because Daniel disobeyed, he is theown into the lion\u0026rsquo;s den. But even in this dangerous space, he remains calm and continues to pray to God. All people have strong grit and resilience. But where are we placing our grit? 3 Facts about prayer # Prayer shapes our identity, not just our actions Notice how Daniel almost immediately goes to pray in his chamber as he\u0026rsquo;s always done. It was a lifelong practice that was so deeply tied to his identity, rather than it being an action. Prayer wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a duty to fulfill. Daniel instead builds a deep relationship with God by constantly seeking him out. His being was shaped by his communion with God. How should we handle hardships and stress? By not being self-reliant. The more we depend on our weak and human selves, the more we burden ourselves. We need faith instead of fear. This won\u0026rsquo;t come to us unless we center our lives over prayer. It\u0026rsquo;s a lifelong process of commitment and love of Christ. Prayer is a lifeline not a last resort Daniel didn\u0026rsquo;t pray the moment trouble came. He actually had already been praying consistently before the crisis arrived. Prayer is more important than life itself. Stop thinking if prayer as a convenience to get what we want. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a religious duty. Prayer is a lifeline built on a life time of discipline. Don\u0026rsquo;t depend on other things because they don\u0026rsquo;t have any value. Have a joyous heart that longs to know God deeply. Only then will you experience a life of persistent prayer and a rise in faith. What are some good opportunities to pray? Eating Right before going to bed Starting studying Before exercise As you drive Right as you wake up. Make a time for it. Prayer assures of God\u0026rsquo;s word. It\u0026rsquo;s not an escape of our troubles When Daniel prays nothing changes He still enters the lion\u0026rsquo;s den. He literally had a HARDER time because he prayed, instead of deliverance. The word of God reveals to us that when we pray, life gets harder. One profound truth of the story: It ends in safety and deliverance. Most importantly the deliverance is applied WITHIN the trial, not pulling Daniel out of the trial. When God could have easily removed troubles from our lives, he instead is right there with us as we go through them. Jesus faced the ultimate punishment for us first, that we would be able to succeed in our small trials. We can only deal with our current problems so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to endure with the ultimate problem of eternal suffering. God has not abandoned us. His word came into fulfillment through Jesus. Prayer: Father we thank you in your revalation to us in shwowing us that our communication to you is not just meaning for us to be delivered from our miseries. But rather it\u0026rsquo;s to help us identify ourselves in you and experience your word come true in both our current life and our eternal life. Hello us to see the value of prayer and have greater grit/persistence more than ever befoe rto pray. to count the cost of prayer for your glory and our joy. help us to be anchored in hope and turn to yoy confidently knowing thar Jesus Christ experienced the ultimate death aleeady.

The feast is reckless because he\u0026rsquo;s chasing dopamine desperately before his death.\nReckless life that speaks to humanity # What does it mean to be reckless? It\u0026rsquo;s to desperately chase something with no avail. When death is imminent, it is human nature to indulge in sensuality and pleasure. Recklessness can be seen in cheating as well. People cheat because they crave and desire something that isn\u0026rsquo;t being found within the relationship. Revelation based on this recklessness # Wisdom can not be found anywhere in the world, only in the word of God. You are a created being by a marvelous creator. You need to turn to your creator to learn more about them. What we need to do as people who are believing in the word of God, our responsibility. # Trust in the word of God. He is the only true source of wisdom. When you reject the word of God, it leads to destruction. In verse 22 it shows that Kiny Belshazzar knew all of the good works of God and his eminence, however he deliberately CHOSE to worship the idols of this world. If you are a christian, and truly know the word of God, you need to abide to it. Or else God will judge you. All Christians will be judged but not condemned. To avoid condemnation, we need to believe in the death and resurrection of the Son, Jesus Christ. We don\u0026rsquo;t get to earn or work for our salvation, but the rewards that we reap in heaven are based upon our trust in him and our works? God revealed to us his truth, and it is our calling to act on this truth. We need to be vessels of life, not of waste. If you think of yourself as a vessel of God and mercy, you will start to act holier. Jesus was the ultimate vessel sacrifice that allows us to be vessels of mercy. If we do this as temples of the holy spirit, we will find signficance and meaning within our lives. Will we ever find satsifcation, meaning, or joy, when you achieve everyrhing for just yourself. You will only be more and more concerned sbout the future. When we act as a vessel of mercy, not only do we find significance in our lives, we start to experience joy. We start to not be shaken by our external circumstances. You will realize the joy thet God has revealed and provided to us really means, because this is how we were designed to be.

The most impossible feats are only possible through God and his wisdom. How do we obtain wisdom?\nNotice how Daniel goes to find his closest friends. He asks them to go to the Lord and pray. Approach God and seek his wisdom. Do everything you can to understand the situation through lens of faith. Spiritual discipline. Fasting, waking up early. Desperate and passionate for God like it was life or death. After the miracle of Jesus\u0026rsquo;s ressurection, and the providence of the Word of God, we no longer have a need for visions. Our wisdom can be derived directly from the the Word and our relationship with God. Spiritual Sight. When you look at the world through this lens of Faith, you will be able to recognize how God is using these things for his plan. Do not worry or be afraid. Trust in God and have faith in Jesus Christ. Daniel\u0026rsquo;s immediate response is to go to God and praise the Lord. Prayer is how we become intimate with Jesus Christ, which is why Satan tries so earnestly to stop us from praying. Prayer will change us. Deepen our relationship with God, know him deeper too.

You can create and provide a Christian experience through the way you worship the Lord. Pursue peace with a content heart. A man with no envy at all.

Considered a very righteous man. But he fell, he commited adultery with a married woman. Nathan a prophet convicts King David about his sin. The story of a rich man and a poor man who had just a single lamb that he cherished very much. Verse Analysis: The entire verse is a psalm of repentance. Three pleas:\nPurity -\u0026gt; Change begins with recognizing our own sin. Verse 1-6. He sees his own sin not through the lens of other people or society, but through the eyes of our Holy and righteous God. Put your mind on the Word of God. Admit your sin and take responsibility for your brokenness. How did David run away from his sin? He shifted blame such as when his general died at the hands of another army, when it was King David who put him there. King David blamed the circumstance, the temptation, the people, external factors, instead of himself. King David\u0026rsquo;s ultimate betrayal, though hurtful and harmful to the people the afflicted, the root of the issue is not submitting to God\u0026rsquo;s rule. He believed that he was unsatisfied with life, so he looked to external factors and coveted something he should not have. He betrayed a good and loving God. Renewal -\u0026gt; Verse 10-11: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me\u0026quot;. David had to realign his heart and understand how continuous and steadfast God\u0026rsquo;s love for him was. He pleads for mercy and submits to God will. He saw God\u0026rsquo;s goodness. Restoration -\u0026gt; Verse 13 “Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you\u0026quot;. He\u0026rsquo;s saying that he remains broken, he still goes through hardship, but I will help turn sinners to you. His change of heart extends beyond himself onto others. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall into the trap of thinking repentance leads you to beauty. It\u0026rsquo;s the brokenness that will lead you to the truth that is: God is what is good in life. When we look for transformations of our heart, we generally desire relief from brokenness. But instead we should use our weak and contrite heart to encourage others.

But note that David isn\u0026rsquo;t asking for an tagimmediate solution. Not a refuge in the sense of freedom of his problems, rather a security amidst danger. A refuge/security that cannot be shaken.\nThere are different kinds of struggles that we face.\nWhy do we need security that cannot be shaken\nBecause nothing on this earth lasts. There is no physical or intellectual foundation that we can base our security on. Emotional too, the death of a loved one can occur. We tend to choose what we can preserve the best because of our natural tendency to play by our strong point. For example: Beauty. Skin products, the way we look. So many people are conscious of what they look like. We try to delay how old we look as much as we can. What happens when we start building our lives on something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t last. Those who run after another god, will suffer more. Where do we find this security\nThe resurrection of Jesus. God promises that death will not be the end of us. You have to truly believe not just in your head but in your hearts. Do you believe in the physical and spiritual resurrection of Jesus. If you truly do, it changes your entire world view. Recognize it. Jesus resurrected. Understand that whatever he claims is the Truth. How can we experience this security\nRecognize that Jesus is our savior and that he truly rose from the dead. Through delight and fellowship of other believers. The true love of God and his character is manifested in the world through the people of God. Joy can be experienced in our lives through other believers in this way. This means that WE as individuals are so important to those around us. What we do within the church is so important. You can only experience the power and the love of God through other believers. You can see through the lives of others that God is truly good. Nobody is perfect but there are ways we can reflect the wuality and image of God that can encourage others to keep going. Be challenged to invest in your community groups. We will always have gluttony. After we seek out one little thing, there will be another that follows shortly. We are insatiable when it comes to earthly things. Thus we should stay grounded in Jesus, the only eternal thing. Prayer: God we thank you for helping us to see that nothing on this world lasts. We confess that every time we chase some kind of security within this world whether financial, popularity, wealth. We pray to you, help us to move away from that. To run after you. Help us Lord to experience the truthfulness of yor word. May your promise and power be manifested in us, as we seek you and delight in the fellowship of one another. God help us and be with us and bless us and may you grant us a security amidst our suffering. Amen.\n"},{"id":30,"href":"/sermons/praying-through-fear/","title":"Praying through Fear","section":"Sermons","content":"2024-10-20 series: Psalm for suffering\nverse: Psalm 3 Context: David is old and he\u0026rsquo;s being chased by thousands of people. His life is crumbling around him. King David commited adultery and murdered her husband and did a lot of other wrongs. Fear is not a negative emotion by itself. It can have positive effects. In 1884, Soren Keurtigard says, \u0026ldquo;fear is the response to a specific identifiable danger or threat\u0026rdquo;. Fear of failure, fear of an angry bear\nThere are two types of responses to fear\nDenial Ventfully express it But we should respond to fear through prayer. Lay your fears down to God, face them in the presence of God. How can we pray through fear?\nPray our fears Bring to the Lord your fears. turn your attention from your situation to God\u0026rsquo;s protection Psalm 3:3 \u0026ldquo;Oh Lord you are a shield ABOUT me\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not a shield like captain america, but rather like a bubble. We should respond to God by facing the danger and fearful situation head on, fully trusting in him. See the substitute that God has given to us and for us, as confirmation that God\u0026rsquo;s words are truly the truth Psalm 3:4 Why do we experience with anxiety\nWe place our faith and identity in security that isn\u0026rsquo;t reliable. Don\u0026rsquo;t rely on yourself. Rely on Jesus. Anxiety has always existed, but today\u0026rsquo;s generation faces anxiety the most. How does david know and trust God? Verse 4:\nWhen youre afraid and have anxieties, forget yourself and focus on others. Move away fron yourself and start loving others in your community.\nDo not give up on trusting in God. Focus on being a blessing others, because you will find yourself to be blessed as well.\nFather we cofness that weare fragile anxious fearful people. So Good we thank you for reminding us of the truth that you are a caring loving trustworthy God.

Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to ask for prayer in times of need.\nPrayer has the power to change lives. If anyone is suffering in any capacity, let that man pray. Are there differences in who prays for us? The prayer of a righteous person has a great impact. \u0026ldquo;Is anyone among you sick, so sick that the body the church cannot pray for you. Call for the elders, the leaders of the church, to come pray for you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another.\u0026rdquo; When you pray with one another, you can be forgiven by God and also experience spiritual restoration.\nWhy is our prayer not always answered or delayed? Our God knows what\u0026rsquo;s best for us. Sometimes the healing of our problems is not the solution. We have to acknowledge that we are not in control. Imagine you as a child asked for things and your parents said \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; every single time. This would be a terrible situation. This is the same relationship we have with God. God will not always say \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;.\nWhy does James call us to pray to God then? It\u0026rsquo;s because when we pray to God, it aligns our hearts to the will of God. We acknowledge that God is better than us and takes away our pride. We acknowledge that God is better than us. We are not our own God.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the impact of prayer? A good life. There are those that pray fervantly and continuously over our well-being, for our peace, for our healing. There is no guarantee that the suffering will go away, but we will find joy and peace amidst our suffering. It will also strengthen us to endure in our trials.\nA righteous person doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we have to be a perfect person Sinful people can also be righteous. Elijah was sinful, insecure, and had a lot of worries. And yet his prayer worked because he prayed continuously and earnestly. Sickness and prayer are related. Perhaps God is keeping us sick so that we can grow closer to gim.\nTherr is power when we pray and cry out together. Completely open and weap. God we need you. God now I really desire for you to work in my life.\n==I need to pray daily and fervantly for those around me==\nPrayer: God we thank you for reminding us of how poweful prayer can be. Lord we confess together: we are so stupid sometimes, not acknowledging how powerful prayer is. Being decived by the enemy to not pray regularly and not put prayer as a priority in our lives. You\u0026rsquo;ve shown us how much prayer really matters. God could you burn our hearts with such passion for your kingdom. That we would become people that dont just pray in suffeeing but also in times of rejoicing. Yoy are a s overign faithful all knowing powerful God who is always always fulfilling your perfect will. So god we want to thank you and we ask you to give us the confidence to not be ashamed to be a fervant prayers.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/sermons/patience/","title":"Patience","section":"Sermons","content":"2024-09-29 series: Acting in grace together\nverse: James 5:7-12 Be patient.

We are products impatient\nPatience -\u0026gt; graciousness and steadiness at the face of delayed gratifications.\nPatience can also mean: Long suffering and remaining steadfast and endure and presevere.\nNot stoicism. It\u0026rsquo;s not about willpower to withstand irritation. It\u0026rsquo;s deeper and more than that.\nStoics that try not to be overwhelmed, relies on your own self. It\u0026rsquo;s not gonna work every time. If you rely on oneself, it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna work everytime. So when you do inevitably fail, you have nobody to blame but yourself.\nHupimenoh - endurance despite what im going through.\nThe story of Job: He lived righteously. He was wealthy, healthy, and basically just thriving. He was almost a perfect role model of a good Christian. But Satan comes and tests him by stripping him of every material thing he has. Patience is enduring and believing that God is still compassionate, merciful, and that he has a perfect will. This is the kind of patience that James is talking about. Not the suprression of your feelings.\nBe patient until the coming of the Lord. His kingdom will be established, no more suffering or tears\nWhat is the opposite of patience? Grumbling. Complaint. Selfpity. The absense of peace creates destruction within us. When you have self pity, and keep thinking about yourself, you will be totally self centered. The outcome of having this self centered mindset, is the destruction of your own life and the lives of others.

As James 4:1 says, what causes quarrels? That our passions are at war within us. What kind of passions? Basically any desire, such as material goods, or our own well being. Stop focusing on yourself, and dedicate your life to others. Look at your family, someone had to dedicate their time, money, effort, in order to nurture you. When nobody cares for you, you are hopeless. That is Hell. The solution: God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Stop operating with your own desires \u0026ldquo;You matter more than anyone else\u0026rdquo;. NOT TRUE. stop being individualistic. You matter just as much as others. Stop prioritizing yourself and serve others. When you give to others, you\u0026rsquo;re gaining life. When you try to gain life, you are experiencing spiritual death.

How can we experience a truly peaceful community together.\nThe devil wull do everything in its power to destroy communities. He will hinder us from humbling ourselves and submitting to God. When we follow others that are not God, you will destroy the community. RESIST the devil. RESIST him. The enemy is so powerful.

Though we are sinful. we were help God invites thiose that are tired and burdened.\nWe need the local church so that sin doesn\u0026rsquo;t permeate within us.

Media and culture has normalized these cruel things. To the point we have become desensitized. The result of all these immoralities is a loss of inheritance and God’s wrath will be upon us.\nBelievers are sealed by the holy spirit from the wrath of God. If you are constantly immoral, you must reflect objectively if you are really saved from Jesus. If you have experienced God’s grace, then you are to get rid of all of these things. Yes of course we fail, but Paul is talking about a continuous indifferent attitude to all of these sins. And that is where the danger lies. Are we indifferent to the current issues of sexual immorality?\nThe root problem of all of these desires is because those are all things that dethrone God from our lives. It’s idolatry. When you pursue these things, you are telling God “you are not enough for me”.\nImitators of God walk in wisdom, light, and spirit. This lifestyle looks like this\nWalk in love Expose darkness Take no part in these evil actions Live fruitfully as children of God Express devotion You have to live in the righteousness of God\nThere’s no list of commands to obey. If we follow a list it becomes a legalistic relationship instead of true faith. How can we be more christ like?\n==But instead let there be thanksgiving== When you are someone who constantly gives thanks, it humbles you. It means that God is enough for us. We are away from pride. We acknowledge our sinfulness. Evil things are unfitting of Christians. Embrace the renewed mind Gospel obedience works only when we realize how unworthy and condemned we are.

Circumstantial, financial, psycholigcal, spiritual, all types of suffering. And we all experience it James says if we suffer, we should pray. Also pray when cheerful. Praise God for the glory he deserves. Active, vocal praise because we are joyful. Sometimes we may feel too tired or feeble to pray. That\u0026rsquo;s why you need people to pray for you. Try to pray for yourself, but in those moments you can\u0026rsquo;t. Have others do it for you. It\u0026rsquo;s a biblical matter to pray for each other. You draw closer to God when you pray. You are restored spiritually. Darkness is lit with the light of Jesus Christ. We should also confess our sins to one another. As you do so, pray for one another, it restores broken relationship.\nWhere does the power of prayer come from? Comes from the one who receives it, not from the one praying. The prayer of a righteous person has greater power. Dont confuse with holiness. Prayer is worthless if you haven\u0026rsquo;t placed your faith in Jesus. Christians are clothed in the righteousness of Christ.\nHow should we pray Fercantly bc we are people like Israelites, wandering, falling into sinful desires. We are all sinners. We must seek prayers and prayers for others.\nWe must intentionally put these into practice.\n"},{"id":47,"href":"/sermons/being-biblically-blessed/","title":"Being Biblically Blessed","section":"Sermons","content":"2023-01-07 series: Blessed to be a blessing\nverse: Genesis 12:2-3\nWe should focus on the proclamation. Blessed to be a blessing is the theme of this year. What does it mean to be biblically blessed? We have recieved something that we don’t necessarily deserve. (general understanding)\nThroughout all of the bible theres a lot of worldly blessings promissed by God. Property, land, freedom, success. But after Jesus comes, you will rarely find these earthly blessings. Youll actually find afflictions and suffering up until Jesus’ ressurection. This is to show what it means to be under the blessings and provisions of God.\nWhat does it mean to be biblically blessed? It means to be under the care, protection and favor of God.\nIn this way, we should be able to serve as leaders and inspirations to others. King Solomon is a good example of this.\nThe reason for Earthly blessings is so that we can be that beacon of light for others. BUT after Jesus came, he showed the world that he is the direct SOURCE of all of these blessings. So the new testament is about sacrifice, suffering, and redemption.\nDont overly emphasize these earthly material blessings.\nBeing blessed is truly just being in the presence of God. Not about comfort, just that God is with us.\nWho is blessed? Those who trust in God’s word.\n"},{"id":48,"href":"/posts/goisforlovers/","title":"(Hu)go Template Primer","section":"Blog","content":"Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates # Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax # Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables # Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions # Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes # When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic # Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration # Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals # If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":49,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":" Step 1.

Don\u0026rsquo;t boast about tomorrow. Don\u0026rsquo;t talk about doing this or that, just do it. Whatever God wills you to do, just take action.\nWe often become so worried and stressed when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as we plan. How can we deal with this?\nWhat causes worries?\nForgetting God in our daily lives. Planning without God in mind. The most prevalent and common sin. Whne we forget God in the daily operation of our life, we assume the role of God in ourselves. \u0026ldquo;I know whats going to happent tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. This leads to an expectation of a certain reality that may not come true. WE DONT KNOW WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING. Leave it all in the hands of God. When plans go well we feel superior, and when they dont we feel inferior. What is the cure?\nWhen we put God into our daily picture and say \u0026ldquo;Lord I don\u0026rsquo;t know, help me\u0026rdquo; You will still have anxiety and worries, but it won\u0026rsquo;t be destructive. We would be disappointed in how things turn out, but we won\u0026rsquo;t fight internally with ourselves. \u0026ldquo;If the Lord wills, we will live\u0026rdquo; Every moment we are breathing is the grace of God. We don\u0026rsquo;t deserve life. We\u0026rsquo;ve done so many things that have destroyed our relationship with God. God is not going to lead you to do anything. You can\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;God is lesding me to do \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;If God wills it\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Lord willing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; This means you are blocking your own responsibility, and also undermining the other person\u0026rsquo;s sense of purpose. Instead, look at your life, it is by God\u0026rsquo;s grace that we are alive, that he has led me to all these places. Appreciate everything that we have and attribute it to God. God is the source behind all of the good things in our life. Thank you for the safe drive home, thank you for the amazing work that I\u0026rsquo;ve done today. We can truly rely on God and be thankful. What is the role of community?\nWithout a community, we can\u0026rsquo;t remember the truth that our lives are because of God\u0026rsquo;s grace. No human on Earth is holy. We don\u0026rsquo;t pray in every moment, we skip reading the bible,etc. Surround yourself with fellow stewards that will serve as reminders for this truth. May you continuously feel the blessings from God to empower you to be a blessing onto others. "},{"id":65,"href":"/sermons/the-danger-of-wealth/","title":"The Danger of Wealth","section":"Sermons","content":"2024-09-22 series: #agt\nverse: James 5:1-6 Your riches will spoil and your coins will corrode. You kept your own pockets fat at the expense of those that work for you.\nWho is James condemning?\nJames is addressing to a particular group of people: Christians. He\u0026rsquo;s talking about a majority of people in the church. The issue is the abuse of wealth. Hoarding it instead of using it for the glory of God. Hoarding is different than saving. Saving is encouraged by the Bible. It makes good stewards. Hoarding is accumulating so much wealth, more than necessary. Are you trying to accumulate wealth so that you can have control over your life? Trust in God, not in wealth. What are the dangers of wealth?\nWealth has a poweful potential to ignore God and the needs of others. Verse 5 says: \u0026ldquo;You have lived your life on earth in luxury and in self-indulgence\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The Bible rebukes money so many times because it\u0026rsquo;s so powerful and will lead us to make paths that will lead to our downfall. It\u0026rsquo;s deceptive because it seems to fulfill security, creates an identity and a sense of fulfillment Jesus says,\u0026ldquo;when you need to pray, this is how you should pray: Father in Heaven hallow be your name\u0026hellip; give us today your daily bread\u0026rdquo;. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry about \u0026ldquo;having enough to be Good/secure for the future\u0026rdquo;. This happens when we place our faith and trust into money instead of God. It\u0026rsquo;s a pathway to self destruction. Wealth has blinded people from the needs of other people. When you invest more into yourself than others, you are following the pathway of accumulating more wealth, that trusts money more than God. Another sign is this: giving sacrificially and generously is an option instead of a priority. Another sign: wealth leads to oppression and injustice of poor people. We are responsible before God to use the wealth that God has provided us with to bless others. God\u0026rsquo;s will and plan is for the needs and sake of others. Paradigm shift: Serving others before yourself. How do we not fall into these traps?\nMatthew 6:33 Prioritize others before yourself. Stop thinking and talking about your faith. Be a doer. Remember that Jesus willingly gave his Life in exchange of our abundant life. Trust upon the ways of God. Look toward eternity. Some questions to think about: How is god leading you to change your spending and saving pattern? How is God leading you to give more to eternal matters? The gospel and care of others\u0026rsquo; needs. Are you trying to evaluate whether your money is being spent in a good way? Would you open up our eyes again to see what Jesus has done, so that we can really live a life of abundance that we\u0026rsquo;re looking for. The abundance of Jesus instead of money. That we would live out our lives as sacrificial and generous people. That seeks to comfort and tend to the needs of others. God transform us, move our hearts and lead us closer to you. Even if it means following Jesus to the end of our days. Help us not t o lose faith and hold on to your truth. Glory is coming. That we may be people rhat act in grace together by being generous to one another for the sake of the gospel.\n"},{"id":66,"href":"/docs/shortcodes/katex/","title":"KaTeX","section":"Shortcodes","content":" KaTeX # KaTeX shortcode let you render math typesetting in markdown document.
