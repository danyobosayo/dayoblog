series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith
verse: Daniel 9:1-23
The church has been on a decline, but it can be reformed. Not by conforming to the world, but by confessing our sins to God. If people want to see a revival of the church, it has to start with every individual member. What does a revived church look like? God&rsquo;s glory is revealed through each individual person.</p><h3 id=introduction>Introduction
<a class=anchor href=#introduction>#</a></h3><p>One issue with Korean/Korean-American churches is the over-emphasis of community.
&ldquo;Prosperity Gospel&rdquo; is the theory that as long as you follow Jesus, your life will be easy, fulfilling, prosperous, etc. But the actual teachings of the gospel share a very different idea. The idea that we are all sinners, and that we are condemned to death. But through the grace and death of our Lord Jesus that we are saved.
There&rsquo;s a lot of division within the christian church today. People are ignoring the word of God for the sake of cultural acceptance. Some churches are now accepting lgbtq, same sex marriage within the clergy, etc. Furthermore, we have the entertainment focused conservative churches that host intense worships that can be considered concerts. These church services have &ldquo;heightened emotions&rdquo;, but a decline in God&rsquo;s word.</p><a href=/sermons/sermons/confession-not-conformity/>...</a></div></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/sermons/sermons/courageous-consistency/>Courageous Consistency</a></h2><div class="flex align-center text-small book-post-date"><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt>

Context: This terrible ruler, the king of Greece, was desecrating the church and persecuting the Jews. Daniel had a terrible vision of this that it brought him illness. But even then, we find that in verse 27 that he rose and &ldquo;went about the king&rsquo;s business&rdquo;. He remains <strong>courageously consistent</strong> although he was facing overwhelming fear and hardship.</p><p>When life is overwhelming and uncertain, how can we also remain courageously consistent just as Daniel was.

The only way to take Daniel down was to attack his devotion to God.</li><li>&ldquo;For 30 days, let nobody worship anyone buy you.

All people have strong grit and resilience. But where are we placing our grit?</li></ul><h5 id=3-facts-about-prayer>3 Facts about prayer
<a class=anchor href=#3-facts-about-prayer>#</a></h5><ol><li>Prayer shapes our identity, not just our actions<ol><li>Notice how Daniel almost <strong>immediately</strong> goes to pray in his chamber <em>as he&rsquo;s always done</em>. It was a lifelong practice that was so deeply tied to his identity, rather than it being an action.</li><li>Prayer wasn&rsquo;t just a duty to fulfill. Daniel instead builds a deep relationship with God by constantly seeking him out. His being was <strong>shaped</strong> by his communion with God.</li></ol></li><li>How should we handle hardships and stress?<ol><li>By not being self-reliant. The more we depend on our weak and human selves, the more we burden ourselves. We need faith instead of fear. This won&rsquo;t come to us unless we center our lives over prayer.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a lifelong process of commitment and love of Christ.</li></ol></li><li>Prayer is a <strong>lifeline</strong> not a <strong>last resort</strong><ol><li>Daniel didn&rsquo;t pray the moment trouble came. He actually had already been praying consistently before the crisis arrived.</li><li>Prayer is more important than life itself. Stop thinking if prayer as a convenience to get what we want. It&rsquo;s not just a religious duty.</li><li>Prayer is a <strong>lifeline</strong> built on a <strong>life time</strong> of discipline. Don&rsquo;t depend on other things because they don&rsquo;t have any value. Have a joyous heart that longs to know God deeply. Only then will you experience a life of persistent prayer and a rise in faith.</li></ol></li><li>What are some good opportunities to pray?<ol><li>Eating</li><li>Right before going to bed</li><li>Starting studying</li><li>Before exercise</li><li>As you drive</li><li>Right as you wake up. Make a time for it.</li></ol></li><li>Prayer assures of God&rsquo;s word. It&rsquo;s not an <em>escape</em> of our troubles<ol><li>When Daniel prays <strong>nothing changes</strong></li><li>He still enters the lion&rsquo;s den. He literally had a HARDER time because he prayed, instead of deliverance.</li><li>The word of God reveals to us that when we pray, life gets harder.</li><li>One profound truth of the story: It ends in safety and deliverance. Most importantly the deliverance is applied WITHIN the trial, not pulling Daniel out of the trial. When God could have easily removed troubles from our lives, he instead is right there with us as we go through them.</li><li>Jesus faced the ultimate punishment for us first, that we would be able to succeed in our small trials.</li><li>We can only deal with our current problems so that we don&rsquo;t have to endure with the <strong>ultimate</strong> problem of eternal suffering. God has not abandoned us. His word came into fulfillment through Jesus.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Father we thank you in your revalation to us in shwowing us that our communication to you is not just meaning for us to be delivered from our miseries. But rather it&rsquo;s to help us identify ourselves in you and experience your word come true in both our current life and our eternal life. Hello us to see the value of prayer and have greater grit/persistence more than ever befoe rto pray. to count the cost of prayer for your glory and our joy. help us to be anchored in hope and turn to yoy confidently knowing thar Jesus Christ experienced the ultimate death aleeady. Help us to continue rising in faith to obey your word.</p><a href=/sermons/sermons/persistent-prayer/>...</a></div></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/sermons/sermons/vessel-of-mercy/>Vessel of Mercy</a></h2><div class="flex align-center text-small book-post-date"><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt>

Summary: The new King Belshazzar, the successor of King Nebuchadnezzar disrespected God by drinking from the chalices from the temple (the house of God). The feast is reckless because he&rsquo;s chasing dopamine desperately before his death.</p><h4 id=reckless-life-that-speaks-to-humanity>Reckless life that speaks to humanity

We need to be vessels of life, not of waste.</li><li>If you think of yourself as a vessel of God and mercy, you will start to act holier. Jesus was the ultimate vessel sacrifice that allows us to be vessels of mercy. If we do this as temples of the holy spirit, we will find signficance and meaning within our lives. Will we ever find satsifcation, meaning, or joy, when you achieve everyrhing for just yourself. You will only be more and more concerned sbout the future. When we act as a vessel of mercy, not only do we find significance in our lives, we start to experience joy. We start to not be shaken by our external circumstances. You will realize the joy thet God has revealed and provided to us really means, because this is how we were designed to be.
Stay disciplined and firm with the word of God</li></ul></div></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/sermons/sermons/faithful-in-the-fire/>Faithful in the Fire</a></h2><div class="flex align-center text-small book-post-date"><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt>

series: Steadfast faith</p><p>verse: Daniel 3
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are cast into the fire for not worshipping Nevuchadnezzar&rsquo;s idol. They survive through the power of Jesus Christ.</p><p>We are human. We have fears of failure and an expectation of loss. We all live in <strong>fire</strong>.</p><p>Main idea: So how can we hold on to our convictions without being consumed by the fire.</p><p>Pluralism: What we think about the <strong>most</strong> is our god. It becomes our greatest concern.
When does suffering consume us
When we stop focusing our time and attention on God
How does God deliver us in those moments.
By encountering Him. Recognize his presence and in his divine protection. He will be WITH us through hard moments rather than removing them. And this is because our God is relational, not a wish maker. He cares and loves us and relates with us. A personal encounter with God in these hard times affirms our love and faithfulness with God.
What do we do to hold on to these convictions.
Focus on the &ldquo;fourth man&rdquo; and not on the fire/heat. Be confident and focused on God.
Recognize that God&rsquo;s suffering was our means for salvation</p><a href=/sermons/sermons/faithful-in-the-fire/>...</a></div></article><article class="markdown book-post"><h2><a href=/sermons/sermons/the-wisdom-of-god/>The Wisdom of God</a></h2><div class="flex align-center text-small book-post-date"><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt>
