The church has been on a decline, but it can be reformed. Not by conforming to the world, but by confessing our sins to God. If people want to see a revival of the church, it has to start with every individual member. What does a revived church look like? God&rsquo;s glory is revealed through each individual person.

One issue with Korean/Korean-American churches is the over-emphasis of community.
&ldquo;Prosperity Gospel&rdquo; is the theory that as long as you follow Jesus, your life will be easy, fulfilling, prosperous, etc. But the actual teachings of the gospel share a very different idea. The idea that we are all sinners, and that we are condemned to death. But through the grace and death of our Lord Jesus that we are saved.
There&rsquo;s a lot of division within the christian church today. People are ignoring the word of God for the sake of cultural acceptance. Some churches are now accepting lgbtq, same sex marriage within the clergy, etc. Furthermore, we have the entertainment focused conservative churches that host intense worships that can be considered concerts. These church services have &ldquo;heightened emotions&rdquo;, but a decline in God&rsquo;s word."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/sermons/confession-not-conformity/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="Confession Not Conformity"><meta property="og:description" content="series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith verse: Daniel 9:1-23 The church has been on a decline, but it can be reformed.

<a class=anchor href=#introduction>#</a></h3><p>One issue with Korean/Korean-American churches is the over-emphasis of community.
&ldquo;Prosperity Gospel&rdquo; is the theory that as long as you follow Jesus, your life will be easy, fulfilling, prosperous, etc. But the actual teachings of the gospel share a very different idea. The idea that we are all sinners, and that we are condemned to death. But through the grace and death of our Lord Jesus that we are saved.
There&rsquo;s a lot of division within the christian church today. People are ignoring the word of God for the sake of cultural acceptance. Some churches are now accepting lgbtq, same sex marriage within the clergy, etc. Furthermore, we have the entertainment focused conservative churches that host intense worships that can be considered concerts. These church services have &ldquo;heightened emotions&rdquo;, but a decline in God&rsquo;s word.</p><p>We can easily face the same issue when we focus <strong>community</strong> over <strong>Christ</strong>.
And on the individual level, sometimes we prioritize a church where we find a sense of belonging, or a tight knit friendship. And at a certain point, we value our community over the actual service.
We need to stop conforming to the <strong>world</strong>.</p><h3 id=what-are-the-signs-of-a-desolate-church>What are the signs of a desolate church?
<a class=anchor href=#what-are-the-signs-of-a-desolate-church>#</a></h3><p>The church&rsquo;s heart and mind are <strong>captured</strong> by forces that are <em>foreign</em> to God.</p><ul><li><strong>Daniel 9:13</strong></li><li>People are following things that are away from God&ndash; from the ways of the world. Israelites are called to live a life of holiness. And they were commanded to do so. But they didn&rsquo;t abide in those rules. They would conform to what the surrounding nations would do because that life was: easier, promised more security, peaceful, and comforting.</li><li>While under Babylonian rule, they became more and more comfortable with Babylonian culture.</li><li>On the individual scale, <strong>we make terrible choices</strong>. We choose to stay awake just a little longer, or immerse ourselves in lust, etc. We often prioritize our own gratification and prosperity, and not following what God has revealed to us. It shows how much we are lacking as believers and followers.
Another sign is <strong>the church feels Guilt and Shame</strong></li><li>We feel shame because we lost purpose and identity. We begin to question ourselves, &ldquo;Are we really any different to non-believers?&rdquo;</li><li>Are you practicing counter-cultural behaviors such as service, loving, sacrifice, discomfort, etc. Is your citizenship truly in heaven?
The church has become a <strong>byword</strong> among others.</li><li>Byword - Disgrade, object of shame</li><li>When others observe us, they don&rsquo;t consider us any different. Our Christian identity is merely a title, and not our citizenship.</li><li>Daniel in the text is confessing that his people have become a byword in the community, and that they are no different to everyone else.</li></ul><h3 id=is-salt--light-a-desolate-church>Is Salt & Light a desolate church?
<a class=anchor href=#is-salt--light-a-desolate-church>#</a></h3><ul><li>In my honest opinion, I think it&rsquo;s difficult to throw everyone under the same umbrella. I think that there are some of us that can be recognized as <strong>different</strong> from other believers, whereas others aren&rsquo;t.</li></ul><h3 id=what-is-the-dangerconsequences-of-a-desolate-church>What is the danger/consequences of a desolate church?
<a class=anchor href=#what-is-the-dangerconsequences-of-a-desolate-church>#</a></h3><p>We lose God&rsquo;s Protection.</p><ul><li><strong>Daniel 9:17</strong> -> It was God who brought them calamity. He stopped protecting them.</li><li>The worst judgment that Mankind can possibly experience is being taken away from the presence of God.
People lose their sense of purpose.</li><li>&ldquo;Where do you place your priorities in your free time?&rdquo;</li><li>We willingly and deliberately shift towards chaos by running away from God</li></ul><h3 id=how-is-a-desolate-church-restored>How is a desolate church restored?
<a class=anchor href=#how-is-a-desolate-church-restored>#</a></h3><p>The confession of Sin</p><ul><li>But not just confession, but rather <strong>convicted confession</strong>. Through <strong>reading scripture</strong></li><li><strong>Daniel 9:2</strong> -> It was only by reading through scripture that he understood how important and urgent it was to confess the sins of himself and the church.</li><li><strong>Jeremiah 12:11</strong> -> Shows how Daniel was convicted by the word of God.<ul><li>When your <strong>prayer is saturated by the word of God</strong>, then you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re praying the <strong>right prayer</strong>.
Align yourself with God&rsquo;s commandment</li></ul></li><li>Be generous</li><li>Be kind</li><li>Serve others</li><li>Lean into discomfort</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be angry
Go towards God. It&rsquo;s not too late. One man&rsquo;s prayer (Daniel&rsquo;s) shed hope to a completely lost nation.
As much as God is great and to be feared, He is merciful and forgiving. Recognize this truth and kneel down in reverence to God. God loves us so much, and he forgives us regardless of what we have committed.</li></ul><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=anchor href=#conclusion>#</a></h3><ul><li>As a church we need to constantly confess to our brokenness and sinfulness. Cause if we don&rsquo;t, then we will conform to the values and culture of the World.</li><li>It is only by faith and through the grace and mercy of God that we are saved. Recognize this beautiful opportunity as believers to share His goodness with the world.</li><li>Saturate our words and our thoughts with scripture</li><li>Pray that God&rsquo;s will will be done, by members of this church.</li></ul></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#what-are-the-signs-of-a-desolate-church>What are the signs of a desolate church?</a></li><li><a href=#is-salt--light-a-desolate-church>Is Salt & Light a desolate church?</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-the-dangerconsequences-of-a-desolate-church>What is the danger/consequences of a desolate church?</a></li><li><a href=#how-is-a-desolate-church-restored>How is a desolate church restored?</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
