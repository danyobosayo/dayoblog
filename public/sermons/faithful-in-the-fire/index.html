verse: Daniel 3
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are cast into the fire for not worshipping Nevuchadnezzar&rsquo;s idol. They survive through the power of Jesus Christ.
We are human. We have fears of failure and an expectation of loss. We all live in fire.
Main idea: So how can we hold on to our convictions without being consumed by the fire.
Pluralism: What we think about the most is our god. It becomes our greatest concern.
When does suffering consume us
When we stop focusing our time and attention on God
How does God deliver us in those moments.
By encountering Him. Recognize his presence and in his divine protection. He will be WITH us through hard moments rather than removing them. And this is because our God is relational, not a wish maker. He cares and loves us and relates with us. A personal encounter with God in these hard times affirms our love and faithfulness with God.
What do we do to hold on to these convictions.
Focus on the &ldquo;fourth man&rdquo; and not on the fire/heat. Be confident and focused on God.
Recognize that God&rsquo;s suffering was our means for salvation"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/sermons/faithful-in-the-fire/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="Faithful in the Fire"><meta property="og:description" content="series: Steadfast faith

This truth would be so valuable that we would give our life and everything for you. That we would not be shaken by the values of this world but instead believe in your words and walk in a way that is pleasing to you. Make this real as we meditate together in the shffering of Jesus Christ. Convict our herats and draw us closer to you that we may leave this place today tranaforms ans conformed in your likeness.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
