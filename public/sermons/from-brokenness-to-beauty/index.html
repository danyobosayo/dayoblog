Verse Analysis: The entire verse is a psalm of repentance.
Three pleas:</p><ul><li>Purity -> Change begins with recognizing our own sin. Verse 1-6. He sees his own sin not through the lens of other people or society, but through the eyes of our Holy and righteous God. Put your mind on the Word of God. Admit your sin and take responsibility for your brokenness. How did David run away from his sin? He shifted blame such as when his general died at the hands of another army, when it was King David who put him there. King David blamed the circumstance, the temptation, the people, external factors, instead of himself. King David&rsquo;s ultimate betrayal, though hurtful and harmful to the people the afflicted, the root of the issue is not submitting to God&rsquo;s rule. He believed that he was unsatisfied with life, so he looked to external factors and coveted something he should not have. He betrayed a good and loving God.</li><li>Renewal -> Verse 10-11: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me". David had to realign his heart and understand how continuous and steadfast God&rsquo;s love for him was. He pleads for mercy and submits to God will. He saw God&rsquo;s goodness.</li><li>Restoration -> Verse 13 “Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you". He&rsquo;s saying that he remains broken, he still goes through hardship, but I will help turn sinners to you. His change of heart extends beyond himself onto others. Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of thinking repentance leads you to beauty. It&rsquo;s the brokenness that will lead you to the truth that is: God is what is good in life.</li></ul><p>When we look for transformations of our heart, we generally desire relief from brokenness. But instead we should use our weak and contrite heart to encourage others. We are not freed from brokenness, but God is with us in our brokenness. To be a beautiful flower amidst the dirt and gravel. May we practice repentance in the proper way to move from brokenness to beauty.</p><p>Prayer: Father your know our pain, what we go through and how much we&rsquo;re suffering. God we desire to be freed from this, yet it feels like an endless cycle of pain and sin. Thank you God for reminding us that your Good still prevails amongst our suffering and that there is a greater rxistence to look forward to after this life. You sent down your one and only Son to death to free us from death. You didn&rsquo;t abandon us. God help us to remmeber that glory is coming, your mercy is greater than any of the sins we have in our lices. You are a good and loving God and may we trust in your faithfulness. Move hearts into repentance today and this week. Forgive us for desiring something else more than you. Forgive us for looking towards things of this world ocer your goodness and grace. Thank you God for loving and accpeting us so dearly. We lrya this all together jn Jesus name.</p><p>How can we move from brokenness to Beauty?</p><ul><li>Repentance</li><li>But what truly is repentance?</li></ul><p>What does David do in Psalm 51 that shows how we can navigate through sinfulness.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
