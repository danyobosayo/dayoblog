&lt;p>verse: Exodus 3:1-4&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Moses is running away after killing an Egyptian worker for mistreating a Hebrew.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In this set of verses, Moses finds an eternally burning bush.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note that we can easily consider this a miracle, however it is also not so easily observed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>There are moments when we go to God asking for something we desire or feel like we need. But sometimes God answers us by making life more difficult/troublesome. There are often things that we don&amp;rsquo;t realize need to be addressed until God tells us they need to be fixed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Alabaster Flask</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-alabaster-flask/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-alabaster-flask/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: College group&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Mark 14:1-11&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In this verse we find a woman who pours an alabaster flask which is worth a year&amp;rsquo;s wage and dumps it on Jesus. It&amp;rsquo;s an expressive act that emphasizes her love for Jesus Christ. This in juxtoposition to Judas betraying Jesus for mere dollars demonstrates how being faithful to Christ will &lt;em>cost&lt;/em> us in a &lt;em>worldly&lt;/em> sense, and &lt;em>rejecting&lt;/em> God will barely provide benefit to us in the worldy sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Jesus was sinless and lived a perfect life. Yet he lives in a sinless broken world, so how can we act accordingly and similarly to him.
In other words, what does God want from his people?
Well obviously obedience, but what does that look like?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seeing as God Sees</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/seeing-as-god-sees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/seeing-as-god-sees/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: The God who remembers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Exodus 2:1-10&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The story of Moses&amp;rsquo; birth. His mother hid him in the reeds and the Phaoroh&amp;rsquo;s daughter decides to spare his life. She names him Moses because she, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Drew him out of the water&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Admist a chaos for the Israelites, the mother of Moses sees it differently.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Instead of fearing for her child&amp;rsquo;s life, she instead has a vision similar to God&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the mother deems her son as, &amp;ldquo;Fine&amp;rdquo; or in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Tov&amp;rdquo;. Which directly translates to &lt;strong>Good&lt;/strong>. This echos the ideas from Genesis 1, where God found things Good. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t about the child&amp;rsquo;s physical appearance. It was about his &lt;em>character&lt;/em> and she found it good.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Obviously as humans, we have a tendency to react things in a worldly manner. But how much more joyful and at peace could we be if we saw things the way God sees it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where is God in this?</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/where-is-god-in-this/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/where-is-god-in-this/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: The God who remembers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Exodus 1:1-22
&amp;ldquo;You won&amp;rsquo;t find any mention of God, miracles, signs, or any amazing parables. Rather hardship, suffering, oppression. But you will see that God is still deeply in work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;li>To give us hope to something &lt;strong>greater&lt;/strong>. Contextually, the Israelites have experienced an absence of God for roughly 400 years. In verse 1, we see the geneological descendants of Abraham in order to show that God is working on the promises he made back in Genesis. God is always there. And he has a masterful plan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God builds slowly. We see that the people nation of Israel grow to great heights. God has been faithfully helping them multply and grow into a nation. God siliently aided the Israelites.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Silence does not equate to God not working with us. He is always with us and constantly watching over us and working within us. He is always holding our hand. Stand firm and abide in Him.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There will be worldly things that will try to pull you away from trusting in God. They will rip you apart and tear you to pieces. And God &lt;strong>allows these moments too&lt;/strong>. God continues to stay silent but also continues to work. This is because he cares about us and would rather us grow than bring immediate relief. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not punishment, it&amp;rsquo;s preparation for something better&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>verse: Daniel 12:1-13&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[[Time Anxiety]]
But time is a gift.
Hold firmly to God&amp;rsquo;s sovereignty, trust in his plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to have the courage to wait beyond time. What does this mean?&lt;/p>

&lt;li>How we spend our time is how we define our identity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Faster is better&amp;rdquo; is an idea that many people in society identify themselves with. Many of us believe that there is value in speed and efficiency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[[Time Famine]] is the idea that no matter how hard we try, we &lt;strong>cannot&lt;/strong> accomplish everything that we desire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time is supposed to be a gift from God to Cherish, but it has devolved into something else.&lt;/li>

 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#what-does-waiting-do-to-us-the-benefit">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Waiting shifts our identity into people of &lt;strong>holiness&lt;/strong> rather than &lt;strong>hopelessness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A difficult season of waiting is not accidental. There&amp;rsquo;s a purpose for our trials. &amp;ldquo;Blessed is he who waits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Periods of waiting allow us to remove impurities and strife. It strengthens our faith in God. Actively waiting produces holiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The wicked will respond to waiting with wickedness and strife. But believers who wait on God actively by keeping their faith will be rewarded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DO NOT FEAR&lt;/strong>: your job is not to climb a ladder or sprint in a race. It&amp;rsquo;s to wait for God to let you do as you do.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Waiting isn&amp;rsquo;t an obstacle, it&amp;rsquo;s not an obstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to look forward to and feel excited about because it&amp;rsquo;s a chance for us to show our piety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Remember God&amp;rsquo;s providence and promises&lt;/em>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not about the circumstance we find ourselves in. It&amp;rsquo;s about who we are and who is behind us, which is God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God promises us an eternal inheritance.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Recognize how weak and insignificant you are.

verse: Daniel 9:1-23
The church has been on a decline, but it can be reformed. Not by conforming to the world, but by confessing our sins to God. If people want to see a revival of the church, it has to start with every individual member. What does a revived church look like? God&amp;rsquo;s glory is revealed through each individual person.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One issue with Korean/Korean-American churches is the over-emphasis of community.
&amp;ldquo;Prosperity Gospel&amp;rdquo; is the theory that as long as you follow Jesus, your life will be easy, fulfilling, prosperous, etc. But the actual teachings of the gospel share a very different idea. The idea that we are all sinners, and that we are condemned to death. But through the grace and death of our Lord Jesus that we are saved.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of division within the christian church today. People are ignoring the word of God for the sake of cultural acceptance. Some churches are now accepting lgbtq, same sex marriage within the clergy, etc. Furthermore, we have the entertainment focused conservative churches that host intense worships that can be considered concerts. These church services have &amp;ldquo;heightened emotions&amp;rdquo;, but a decline in God&amp;rsquo;s word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Courageous Consistency</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/courageous-consistency/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/courageous-consistency/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Daniel 8:27
Context: This terrible ruler, the king of Greece, was desecrating the church and persecuting the Jews. Daniel had a terrible vision of this that it brought him illness. But even then, we find that in verse 27 that he rose and &amp;ldquo;went about the king&amp;rsquo;s business&amp;rdquo;. He remains &lt;strong>courageously consistent&lt;/strong> although he was facing overwhelming fear and hardship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When life is overwhelming and uncertain, how can we also remain courageously consistent just as Daniel was. Because we can&amp;rsquo;t so this by our own power.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resting in the Unknown</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/resting-in-the-unknown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/resting-in-the-unknown/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Daniel 7:15-28&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A man receives a direct vision from God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &amp;lsquo;ancient of days&amp;rsquo; executes judgment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Daniel holds on to the tension of not knowing. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t demand understanding, but instead continues to rest in both the unknown and peace.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>People are generally restless with the unknown. We seek answers at every turn. But finding the answer won&amp;rsquo;t result in peace. Often times the answer isn&amp;rsquo;t clear, thus the increase in knowledge leads to confusion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Persistent Prayer</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/persistent-prayer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/persistent-prayer/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Daniel 6:10&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>King Darius persian ruler&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Daniel is old now ~80 years old&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People were trying to dig up dirt and find any flaw in his character. The only way to take Daniel down was to attack his devotion to God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;For 30 days, let nobody worship anyone buy you. If you break this law they will be thrown into the Lion&amp;rsquo;s den&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Daniel is being asked to temporarily stop praying for God. Realistically he could reason and say that this is just a small break. But no, he could not compromise this value.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because Daniel disobeyed, he is theown into the lion&amp;rsquo;s den. But even in this dangerous space, he remains calm and continues to pray to God.
All people have strong grit and resilience. But where are we placing our grit?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h5 id="3-facts-about-prayer">
 3 Facts about prayer
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#3-facts-about-prayer">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h5>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Prayer shapes our identity, not just our actions
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Notice how Daniel almost &lt;strong>immediately&lt;/strong> goes to pray in his chamber &lt;em>as he&amp;rsquo;s always done&lt;/em>. It was a lifelong practice that was so deeply tied to his identity, rather than it being an action.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayer wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a duty to fulfill. Daniel instead builds a deep relationship with God by constantly seeking him out. His being was &lt;strong>shaped&lt;/strong> by his communion with God.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How should we handle hardships and stress?
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>By not being self-reliant. The more we depend on our weak and human selves, the more we burden ourselves. We need faith instead of fear. This won&amp;rsquo;t come to us unless we center our lives over prayer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s a lifelong process of commitment and love of Christ.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayer is a &lt;strong>lifeline&lt;/strong> not a &lt;strong>last resort&lt;/strong>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Daniel didn&amp;rsquo;t pray the moment trouble came. He actually had already been praying consistently before the crisis arrived.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayer is more important than life itself. Stop thinking if prayer as a convenience to get what we want. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a religious duty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayer is a &lt;strong>lifeline&lt;/strong> built on a &lt;strong>life time&lt;/strong> of discipline. Don&amp;rsquo;t depend on other things because they don&amp;rsquo;t have any value. Have a joyous heart that longs to know God deeply. Only then will you experience a life of persistent prayer and a rise in faith.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are some good opportunities to pray?
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Eating&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right before going to bed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Starting studying&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before exercise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As you drive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right as you wake up. Make a time for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayer assures of God&amp;rsquo;s word. It&amp;rsquo;s not an &lt;em>escape&lt;/em> of our troubles
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>When Daniel prays &lt;strong>nothing changes&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He still enters the lion&amp;rsquo;s den. He literally had a HARDER time because he prayed, instead of deliverance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The word of God reveals to us that when we pray, life gets harder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One profound truth of the story: It ends in safety and deliverance. Most importantly the deliverance is applied WITHIN the trial, not pulling Daniel out of the trial. When God could have easily removed troubles from our lives, he instead is right there with us as we go through them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jesus faced the ultimate punishment for us first, that we would be able to succeed in our small trials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can only deal with our current problems so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to endure with the &lt;strong>ultimate&lt;/strong> problem of eternal suffering. God has not abandoned us. His word came into fulfillment through Jesus.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Prayer: Father we thank you in your revalation to us in shwowing us that our communication to you is not just meaning for us to be delivered from our miseries. But rather it&amp;rsquo;s to help us identify ourselves in you and experience your word come true in both our current life and our eternal life. Hello us to see the value of prayer and have greater grit/persistence more than ever befoe rto pray. to count the cost of prayer for your glory and our joy. help us to be anchored in hope and turn to yoy confidently knowing thar Jesus Christ experienced the ultimate death aleeady. Help us to continue rising in faith to obey your word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vessel of Mercy</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/vessel-of-mercy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/vessel-of-mercy/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Anchored in hope, rising in faith&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Trust in the word of God. He is the only true source of wisdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you reject the word of God, it leads to destruction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In verse 22 it shows that Kiny Belshazzar knew all of the good works of God and his eminence, however he deliberately CHOSE to worship the idols of this world.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are a christian, and truly know the word of God, you need to &lt;strong>abide&lt;/strong> to it. Or else God will judge you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All Christians will be judged but not condemned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To avoid condemnation, we need to believe in the death and resurrection of the Son, Jesus Christ.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We don&amp;rsquo;t get to earn or work for our salvation, but the rewards that we reap in heaven are based upon our trust in him and our works?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God revealed to us his truth, and it is our calling to act on this truth. We need to be vessels of life, not of waste.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you think of yourself as a vessel of God and mercy, you will start to act holier. Jesus was the ultimate vessel sacrifice that allows us to be vessels of mercy. If we do this as temples of the holy spirit, we will find signficance and meaning within our lives. Will we ever find satsifcation, meaning, or joy, when you achieve everyrhing for just yourself. You will only be more and more concerned sbout the future. When we act as a vessel of mercy, not only do we find significance in our lives, we start to experience joy. We start to not be shaken by our external circumstances. You will realize the joy thet God has revealed and provided to us really means, because this is how we were designed to be.
Stay disciplined and firm with the word of God&lt;/li>

&lt;p>verse: Matthew 5:5&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it mean to be meek?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Biblical definition: Not weakness, but strength under control. Submissive but strong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easily imposed on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Humble, slow to anger&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Meekness is a difficult quality to achieve.
It’s similar to stoicism. Not defensive or confrontational.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>verse: Daniel 4:28-37
King Nebuchadnezzar is humiliated and humbled because he was so prideful. Not just a boastful nature, but a &lt;strong>spiritual pride&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do we have spiritual pride?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spiritual pride leaves to an obsession with control. Nebechadnezzar thinks that the fruits of his labor all came by his own doing. Spiritual restoration occured when he let go of his control and gave all glory to God most high.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Faithful in the Fire</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/faithful-in-the-fire/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/faithful-in-the-fire/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Steadfast faith&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Daniel 3
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are cast into the fire for not worshipping Nevuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s idol. They survive through the power of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are human. We have fears of failure and an expectation of loss. We all live in &lt;strong>fire&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Main idea: So how can we hold on to our convictions without being consumed by the fire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pluralism: What we think about the &lt;strong>most&lt;/strong> is our god. It becomes our greatest concern.
When does suffering consume us
When we stop focusing our time and attention on God
How does God deliver us in those moments.
By encountering Him. Recognize his presence and in his divine protection. He will be WITH us through hard moments rather than removing them. And this is because our God is relational, not a wish maker. He cares and loves us and relates with us. A personal encounter with God in these hard times affirms our love and faithfulness with God.
What do we do to hold on to these convictions.
Focus on the &amp;ldquo;fourth man&amp;rdquo; and not on the fire/heat. Be confident and focused on God.
Recognize that God&amp;rsquo;s suffering was our means for salvation&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Straying Away From Idolatry</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/straying-away-from-idolatry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/straying-away-from-idolatry/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Pastor Myung&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There must only be God in our hearts when we desire to worship the Lord. There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any ulterior motive or something that takes precedence such as friends or the pastor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The israelites struggled with faith in the Lord because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>see&lt;/em> him.

&lt;p>Where do we place our trust in today? Ourselves, our pride?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is wisdom?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>God&amp;rsquo;s insight for the &lt;em>best&lt;/em> way to live.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The book of Daniel shows this when God reveals the mystery when no person of flesh could.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>verse: Daniel 1:1-21&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for us to regain true joy, we must first earnestly strive for the restoration of worship.
Joy begins with proper worship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How can we become proper worshipers of God?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proper worship begins with recognizing the risk of conformity.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Daniel and his friends were forced to assimilate into Babylonian culture. They had to adapt to the Babylonian lifestyle, customs, etc. Even new names.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We live in a time of spiritual captivity. We need to recognize and see this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are surrounded by influences. It could take the shape of a work focused grindset community, or a friend group that makes racist remarks. Culture can so easily be focused on sin. We can&amp;rsquo;t worship God when we induldge in all of these sins and conform to the sinful culture that surrounds you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By recognizing the risk of the influence around us, we can rely on God and make changed to our lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Basically, the first step to fighting sin is recognizing it.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Proper risk is about resolving with the righteous decisions&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Christmas</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-meaning-of-christmas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-meaning-of-christmas/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Pastor Myung&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The day that God showed us mercy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A day that God showed his faithfulness&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>An important detail to recognize:
Mary was afraid and felt inferior. But God empowered her saying that she is a child of God and to stand firm on your two feet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more context at this time for Israelites. They have been enslaved for generations. Egypt, assyria, Babylon, and now Rome.

&lt;p>verse: Psalm 119
the longest verse in the bible. It&amp;rsquo;s the written account of David and his devout faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People want to make the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; choice for themselves such as &amp;ldquo;what should we eat?&amp;rdquo;. But this created stress in our lives. But what&amp;rsquo;s a decision that we can &lt;strong>never&lt;/strong> forget. It brings joy, peace, stability.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Find delight in the word&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dedictate your life to the word&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look to the hopeful future and be present in the loment.
Bottom line is to treasure the word of God.
How can you treasure God when yoy don&amp;rsquo;t treasure the word? Treasuring the word, following the commandments, will help you to make the right decisions and run away from sin.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s societal climate makes reading in general, and also specifically the bible, a great struggle. We are so immersed in a culture of instant gratification. I really have to immerse myself in the word of God and absorb and be mindful of it. This is where we should derive our joy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Praying Our Envy</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/praying-our-envy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/praying-our-envy/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Psalm for suffering&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The issue is the abuse of wealth. Hoarding it instead of using it for the glory of God. Hoarding is different than saving.&lt;/li>

Peace makes peace&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is wisdom&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fearing the Lord&lt;/li>
&lt;li>According to verse 13, Wisdom is not just known, but is shown. &amp;ldquo;Let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wisdom is Pure - Morally blameless
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Peaceable - people who dislike conflict. Put reconciliation into action. Means to work with others even though it&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gentleness - As you hear good arguments, that you are willing to change. Flexible, yielding to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open to reason - Persuadable, a good listener&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full of mercy - Taking your resources and putting it to use for others in need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Impartial - Show dignity and respect to all people, because we are all created in the image of God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sincere - Integrity, be wise in public and in private.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We must show these things if you want to be wise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When we are wise, people will come to you, they will be drawn to these characteristics.
How can we implement it&lt;/li>

&lt;p>verse: James 1:26-2:17&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we act like a biblical gospel centered community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People generally seek a place of love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What kind of community are we supposed to be?
We are called to be &lt;strong>just&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>merciful&lt;/strong>
To not have favoritism.
You need to bear the burden, do the hard thing. Treat everyone equally.
How welcoming am I of others?
We should be encouraged to do the hard thing. Go make the lonely feel less lonely.
We need to also be merciful as in caring for those in need. Not just being kind, but meeting the needs of others.
If we are not exercises mercy, or justness, we will be judged by God.
We need to be merciful because it&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of our faith, God&amp;rsquo;s mercy to us.
Why is it so hard to achieve?
It&amp;rsquo;s not that we don&amp;rsquo;t care for others, but we are inherently fearful of these situations.
We are really shameful people and don&amp;rsquo;t like to share our struggles. But do we care enough to invest in our community?
We chase after &lt;strong>human glory&lt;/strong> and not &lt;strong>God&amp;rsquo;s glory&lt;/strong>.
The desire to be powerful, rich, social status.
We favore those that make us feel safe. And we struggle to jepoardize that.
When we act in favoritism, it shows that we do not understand what God&amp;rsquo;s vision is.
&amp;ldquo;All people are built in the image of God&amp;rdquo;. No matter who it is, no matter how rude, low iq, low eq, anything. We should not insult ANYONE. We should not make people feel worthless.
How can we achieve that
Carefully look upon the glory of Christ. Even if it pains you, even if it&amp;rsquo;s burdensome, you should feel inclined to do good works. To take the harder path.
Be radical, in the way we speak, act, and love onto others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Be a doer not a hearer</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/be-a-doer-not-a-hearer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/be-a-doer-not-a-hearer/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Acting in grace together&lt;/p>

Look and hear and read and be absorbed into the perfect law.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What DOes It Mean to Live by Faith</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/what-does-it-mean-to-live-by-faith/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/what-does-it-mean-to-live-by-faith/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: P.A Speaking&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Hebrews 12:1-2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should inherently be in pursuit of God. We are born to immitate, and we should be immitating that which is perfect, which is God.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We usually follow those around us though. It&amp;rsquo;s not wrong to be influenced by others, but we must follow those &lt;strong>worth following.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There should be a goal to reach. Without purpose we cannot find motivation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though we may feel alone, you must know that we are not alone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I should recieve God's Word</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/how-i-should-recieve-gods-word/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/how-i-should-recieve-gods-word/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Acting in grace together

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;19 Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; 20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. 21 Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Graciously acting together. The most important part of christian life is to be a &amp;ldquo;born again believer&amp;rdquo;. A life that is fully influenced by christ. Born against isn&amp;rsquo;t sinless, but toy should have a pursuit of a different kind of life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Portrait of Ministry</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/a-portrait-of-ministry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/a-portrait-of-ministry/</guid><description>&lt;p>series:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>verse: Genesis 2:16-17&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human souls were not made to bear outcomes. We are not in control of the way things turn out. But God does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Garden of Eden was a place of abundance. This story isn&amp;rsquo; about restriction and limitation and rules. God asks us to care for and maintain this beautiful orchard. We just have to take part of our own responsibilities, and also enjoy the fruit. God invites us to eat until we cant anymore. This center tree is also good but we are just not ready.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is Home?</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/what-is-home/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/what-is-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: An inviting God&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Ephesians 5&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is home? Home is joy comfort rest security etc
But it can also have conflict bitterness frustration and abuse.
Everyone desires a home to be filled with joy But is this possible?
How do people relate to each other? How do we be more christ like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesus Christ must be lord in all your relations. family, lover, employer. in everything. Have Christ be the center of your relationship. Every aspect in life is grounded in Christ. This is a picture of heaven on Earth, and heaven is our home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Invited to Rest</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/invited-to-rest/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/invited-to-rest/</guid><description>&lt;p>series:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Matthew 11:25-30&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To know Jesus as the son of God is an invitation to rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesus reveals the father to those he chooses?
He invites weary sinners into his rest.
Verse 25, Jesus declares himself as the promised Messiah.
God is easier to understand when you notice all the love he has for us.
Jesus is unique as he is THE son if God. Jesus transcends.
A lot of the time we discuss how Jesus is similar to us. He is born in the flesh, suffered, and died. But at the same time he is not like is at all. He is unrelatable, intangible.
God reveals himself to us and it&amp;rsquo;s a gracious decision. God is dealing with a race of sinners of which he owes nothing.
Why should we be happy that he hides and reveals. Because he has revealed it to us. We are his little children. Though we are sinful. we were help
God invites thiose that are tired and burdened.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being Imitators of God</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/being-imitators-of-god/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/being-imitators-of-god/</guid><description>&lt;p>series:&lt;/p>

 Imitators of God
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#imitators-of-god">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>People by nature are imitators
Don’t imitate the world, imitate God&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“How can we organically imitate God as Paul urges us to do”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It’s not just the performance of immoral acts, it must not even be mentioned. Media and culture has normalized these cruel things. To the point we have become desensitized. The result of all these immoralities is a loss of inheritance and God’s wrath will be upon us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Prayer</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-power-of-prayer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-power-of-prayer/</guid><description>&lt;p>series:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: 1 James 5:13-18
&lt;strong>What does prayer do?&lt;/strong>
the purpose is to bring healing from suffering
Verse 13: is anyone along you suffering?
Circumstantial, financial, psycholigcal, spiritual, all types of suffering. And we all experience it
James says if we suffer, we should pray.
Also pray when cheerful. Praise God for the glory he deserves. Active, vocal praise because we are joyful.
Sometimes we may feel too tired or feeble to pray. That&amp;rsquo;s why you need people to pray for you. Try to pray for yourself, but in those moments you can&amp;rsquo;t. Have others do it for you.
It&amp;rsquo;s a biblical matter to pray for each other.
You draw closer to God when you pray. You are restored spiritually. Darkness is lit with the light of Jesus Christ.
We should also confess our sins to one another. As you do so, pray for one another, it restores broken relationship.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being Biblically Blessed</title><link>http://localhost:61682/sermons/being-biblically-blessed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61682/sermons/being-biblically-blessed/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Blessed to be a blessing&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Genesis 12:2-3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should focus on the proclamation.
Blessed to be a blessing is the theme of this year.
What does it mean to be biblically blessed?
We have recieved something that we don’t necessarily deserve. (general understanding)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout all of the bible theres a lot of worldly blessings promissed by God. Property, land, freedom, success. But after Jesus comes, you will rarely find these earthly blessings. Youll actually find afflictions and suffering up until Jesus’ ressurection.
This is to show what it means to be under the blessings and provisions of God.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
