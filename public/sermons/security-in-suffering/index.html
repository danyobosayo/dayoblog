David calls out to God for refuge because he has been experiencing and dealing with various problems such as being a murderer and adulterer, and also bc of the sins of others such as those that seek to end his life. But note that David isn&rsquo;t asking for an tagimmediate solution. Not a refuge in the sense of freedom of his problems, rather a security amidst danger. A refuge/security that cannot be shaken."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:61827/sermons/security-in-suffering/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="Security in Suffering"><meta property="og:description" content="series: Psalm for Suffering

But note that David isn&rsquo;t asking for an tagimmediate solution. Not a refuge in the sense of freedom of his problems, rather a security amidst danger. A refuge/security that cannot be shaken.</p><p>There are different kinds of struggles that we face.</p><p>Why do we need security that cannot be shaken</p><ul><li>Because nothing on this earth lasts.</li><li>There is no physical or intellectual foundation that we can base our security on.</li><li>Emotional too, the death of a loved one can occur.</li><li>We tend to choose what we can preserve the best because of our natural tendency to play by our strong point.<ul><li>For example: Beauty. Skin products, the way we look. So many people are conscious of what they look like. We try to delay how old we look as much as we can.</li></ul></li><li>What happens when we start building our lives on something that doesn&rsquo;t last.<ul><li>Those who run after another god, will suffer more.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Where do we find this security</p><ul><li>The resurrection of Jesus. God promises that death will not be the end of us. You have to truly believe not just in your head but in your hearts. Do you believe in the physical and spiritual resurrection of Jesus. If you truly do, it changes your entire world view. Recognize it. Jesus resurrected. Understand that whatever he claims is the Truth.</li></ul><p>How can we experience this security</p><ul><li>Recognize that Jesus is our savior and that he truly rose from the dead.</li><li>Through delight and fellowship of other believers.</li><li>The true love of God and his character is manifested in the world through the people of God. Joy can be experienced in our lives through other believers in this way.</li><li>This means that WE as individuals are so important to those around us.</li><li>What we do within the church is so important.</li><li>You can only experience the power and the love of God through other believers.</li><li>You can see through the lives of others that God is truly good.</li><li>Nobody is perfect but there are ways we can reflect the wuality and image of God that can encourage others to keep going.</li><li>Be challenged to invest in your community groups.
We will always have gluttony. After we seek out one little thing, there will be another that follows shortly. We are insatiable when it comes to earthly things. Thus we should stay grounded in Jesus, the only eternal thing.</li></ul><p>Prayer: God we thank you for helping us to see that nothing on this world lasts. We confess that every time we chase some kind of security within this world whether financial, popularity, wealth. We pray to you, help us to move away from that. To run after you. Help us Lord to experience the truthfulness of yor word. May your promise and power be manifested in us, as we seek you and delight in the fellowship of one another. God help us and be with us and bless us and may you grant us a security amidst our suffering. Amen.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
