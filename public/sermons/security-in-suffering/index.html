  verse: Psalms 16

  Context:
  #

David calls out to God for refuge because he has been experiencing and dealing with various problems such as being a murderer and adulterer, and also because of the sins of others such as those that seek to end his life. But note that David isn&rsquo;t asking for an immediate solution. Not a refuge in the sense of freedom of his problems, rather a security amidst danger. A refuge/security that cannot be shaken.">

<p>David calls out to God for refuge because he has been experiencing and dealing with various problems such as being a murderer and adulterer, and also because of the sins of others such as those that seek to end his life. But note that David isn&rsquo;t asking for an <strong>immediate solution</strong>. Not a refuge in the sense of freedom of his problems, rather a <strong>security</strong> amidst danger. A refuge/security that cannot be shaken.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-security-that-cannot-be-shaken">
  Why do we need security that cannot be shaken?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-do-we-need-security-that-cannot-be-shaken">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Because <strong>nothing secular on this earth is lasting</strong>. And as a result, there is no physical or intellectual foundation that we can base our security on. Note that this can apply to emotional things as well, for example the death of a loved one can occur.
Humans have a tendency to <strong>preserve</strong> our interests to the best of our ability. To maintain a certain status quo.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: So many people are conscious of what they look like. We try to delay how old we look as much as we can whether through skincare products, nutrition, fitness, or sleep.
<strong>What happens when we start building our lives on something that doesn&rsquo;t last?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When those things inevitably come crumbling down, despair follows suit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-we-find-this-security">
  Where do we find this security?
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-do-we-find-this-security">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The resurrection of Jesus. God promises that death will not be the end of us. You have to truly believe not just in your head but in your heart. Do you believe in the physical and spiritual resurrection of Jesus. If you truly do, it <strong>changes your entire world view</strong>. Recognize it. Jesus resurrected. Understand that whatever he claims is the Truth.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-experience-this-security">
  How can we experience this security?
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-can-we-experience-this-security">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Recognize that Jesus is our savior and that he truly rose from the dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through delight and fellowship of other believers.</li>
<li>The true love of God and his character is manifested in the world through the people of God. Joy can be experienced in our lives through other believers in this way.</li>
<li>This means that WE as individuals are so important to those around us.</li>
<li>What we do within the church is so important.</li>
<li>You can best experience the power and the love of God through other believers.</li>
<li>You can see through the lives of others that God is truly good.</li>
<li>Nobody is perfect but there are ways we can reflect the quality and image of God that can encourage others to keep going.</li>
<li>Be challenged to invest in your community groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-we-deal-with-gluttony">
  How can we deal with gluttony?
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-can-we-deal-with-gluttony">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Gluttony is inherent to our sinful nature. After we seek out one little thing, there will be another that follows shortly. We are <strong>insatiable</strong> when it comes to earthly things. Thus we should stay grounded in Jesus, the only eternal thing which will nourish us in an unfathomable way.</p>
<h2 id="prayer">
  Prayer:
  <a class="anchor" href="#prayer">#</a>
</h2>
<p>God we thank you for helping us to see that nothing on this world lasts. We confess that every time we chase some kind of security within this world whether financial, popularity, wealth. We pray to you, help us to move away from that. To run after you. Help us Lord to experience the truthfulness of yor word. May your promise and power be manifested in us, as we seek you and delight in the fellowship of one another. God help us and be with us and bless us and may you grant us a security amidst our suffering. Amen.</p>
