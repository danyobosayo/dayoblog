verse: Exodus 2:1-10

The story of Moses&rsquo; birth. His mother hid him in the reeds and the Phaoroh&rsquo;s daughter decides to spare his life. She names him Moses because she, &ldquo;Drew him out of the water&rdquo;
Admist a chaos for the Israelites, the mother of Moses sees it differently.

Instead of fearing for her child&rsquo;s life, she instead has a vision similar to God&rsquo;s.


It&rsquo;s important to note that the mother deems her son as, &ldquo;Fine&rdquo; or in Hebrew, &ldquo;Tov&rdquo;. Which directly translates to Good. This echos the ideas from Genesis 1, where God found things Good. It wasn&rsquo;t about the child&rsquo;s physical appearance. It was about his character and she found it good.

Obviously as humans, we have a tendency to react things in a worldly manner. But how much more joyful and at peace could we be if we saw things the way God sees it?"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/sermons/seeing-as-god-sees/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="Seeing as God Sees"><meta property="og:description" content="series: The God who remembers
