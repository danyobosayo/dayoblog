verse: James 5:1-6
Your riches will spoil and your coins will corrode. You kept your own pockets fat at the expense of those that work for you.
Who is James condemning?

James is addressing to a particular group of people: Christians. He&rsquo;s talking about a majority of people in the church.
The issue is the abuse of wealth. Hoarding it instead of using it for the glory of God. Hoarding is different than saving.
Saving is encouraged by the Bible. It makes good stewards. Hoarding is accumulating so much wealth, more than necessary.
Are you trying to accumulate wealth so that you can have control over your life? Trust in God, not in wealth.

Trust in God, not in wealth.</li></ul><p>What are the dangers of wealth?</p><ul><li>Wealth has a poweful potential to ignore God and the needs of others.</li><li>Verse 5 says: &ldquo;You have lived your life on earth in luxury and in self-indulgence&mldr;&rdquo;</li><li>The Bible rebukes money so many times because it&rsquo;s so powerful and will lead us to make paths that will lead to our downfall. It&rsquo;s deceptive because it seems to fulfill security, creates an identity and a sense of fulfillment</li><li>Jesus says,&ldquo;when you need to pray, this is how you should pray: Father in Heaven hallow be your name&mldr; give us today your daily bread&rdquo;. You shouldn&rsquo;t worry about &ldquo;having enough to be Good/secure for the future&rdquo;. This happens when we place our faith and trust into money instead of God. It&rsquo;s a pathway to self destruction.</li><li>Wealth has blinded people from the needs of other people.</li><li>When you invest more into yourself than others, you are following the pathway of accumulating more wealth, that trusts money more than God. Another sign is this: giving sacrificially and generously is an option instead of a priority.</li><li>Another sign: wealth leads to oppression and injustice of poor people. We are responsible before God to use the wealth that God has provided us with to bless others. God&rsquo;s will and plan is for the needs and sake of others. Paradigm shift: Serving others before yourself.</li></ul><p>How do we not fall into these traps?</p><ul><li>Matthew 6:33</li><li>Prioritize others before yourself.</li><li>Stop thinking and talking about your faith. Be a doer.</li><li>Remember that Jesus willingly gave his Life in exchange of our abundant life.</li><li>Trust upon the ways of God. Look toward eternity.</li><li>Some questions to think about:<ul><li>How is god leading you to change your spending and saving pattern?</li><li>How is God leading you to give more to eternal matters? The gospel and care of others&rsquo; needs.</li><li>Are you trying to evaluate whether your money is being spent in a good way?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Would you open up our eyes again to see what Jesus has done, so that we can really live a life of abundance that we&rsquo;re looking for. The abundance of Jesus instead of money. That we would live out our lives as sacrificial and generous people. That seeks to comfort and tend to the needs of others. God transform us, move our hearts and lead us closer to you. Even if it means following Jesus to the end of our days. Help us not t o lose faith and hold on to your truth. Glory is coming. That we may be people rhat act in grace together by being generous to one another for the sake of the gospel.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
