The meaning of christmas:

The day that God showed us mercy.
A day that God showed his faithfulness

An important detail to recognize:
Mary was afraid and felt inferior. But God empowered her saying that she is a child of God and to stand firm on your two feet.
For more context at this time for Israelites. They have been enslaved for generations. Egypt, assyria, Babylon, and now Rome. They were always proud and were persistent in their faith that everything will be okay. But Rome was an iron fist and people had some doubt over their situation."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:61682/sermons/the-meaning-of-christmas/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="The Meaning of Christmas"><meta property="og:description" content="series: Pastor Myung
