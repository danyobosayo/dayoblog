verse: 1 James 5:13-18
What does prayer do?
the purpose is to bring healing from suffering
Verse 13: is anyone along you suffering?
Circumstantial, financial, psycholigcal, spiritual, all types of suffering. And we all experience it
James says if we suffer, we should pray.
Also pray when cheerful. Praise God for the glory he deserves. Active, vocal praise because we are joyful.
Sometimes we may feel too tired or feeble to pray. That&rsquo;s why you need people to pray for you. Try to pray for yourself, but in those moments you can&rsquo;t. Have others do it for you.
It&rsquo;s a biblical matter to pray for each other.
You draw closer to God when you pray. You are restored spiritually. Darkness is lit with the light of Jesus Christ.
We should also confess our sins to one another. As you do so, pray for one another, it restores broken relationship."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:61995/sermons/the-power-of-prayer/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="dayowrites"><meta property="og:title" content="The Power of Prayer"><meta property="og:description" content="series:

<strong>What does prayer do?</strong>
the purpose is to bring healing from suffering
Verse 13: is anyone along you suffering?
Circumstantial, financial, psycholigcal, spiritual, all types of suffering. And we all experience it
James says if we suffer, we should pray.
Also pray when cheerful. Praise God for the glory he deserves. Active, vocal praise because we are joyful.
Sometimes we may feel too tired or feeble to pray. That&rsquo;s why you need people to pray for you. Try to pray for yourself, but in those moments you can&rsquo;t. Have others do it for you.
It&rsquo;s a biblical matter to pray for each other.
You draw closer to God when you pray. You are restored spiritually. Darkness is lit with the light of Jesus Christ.
We should also confess our sins to one another. As you do so, pray for one another, it restores broken relationship.</p><p><strong>Where does the power of prayer come from?</strong>
Comes from the one who receives it, not from the one praying.
The prayer of a righteous person has greater power.
Dont confuse with holiness.
Prayer is worthless if you haven&rsquo;t placed your faith in Jesus. Christians are clothed in the righteousness of Christ.</p><p><strong>How should we pray</strong>
Fercantly bc we are people like Israelites, wandering, falling into sinful desires. We are all sinners. We must seek prayers and prayers for others.</p><p>We must intentionally put these into practice.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
