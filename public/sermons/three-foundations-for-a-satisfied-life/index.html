  verse: Exodus 13:1-22
  #


  Main Idea:
  #

Today we will look at spiritual practices that aren&rsquo;t just helpful, but foundational to a joyful and satisfying Christian life. It will shape you to live faithfully and wisefully, even in times of uncertainty.

  Context:
  #

The Israelites have finally escaped Egypt after the 10 plagues and are beginning their journey through the wildnerness.

  Foundation #1: First is for the Father
  #

Found in verse 2, God says to mose, &ldquo;Consecrate to me all the firstborn&hellip;&rdquo;. This commandment is saying that the first and foremost is for the father. It&rsquo;s not referring to control, rather prioritizing a relationship with God. Our lives are objectively undeserved. One man suffered a terrible death so that we may live.  Consecrating the first born is a constant reminder of the great act of Jesus to die on the cross for our sins. Note that you cannot serve two masters. Often times we chase after worldly things such as money, sexual validation, etc., but no matter how much of those things we possess, the dopaminergic feeling eventually fades. There&rsquo;s an alarming statistic of younger people giving much less to the church. And through survey, the findings showed that the primary reason behind this is that younger people stopped trusting that the church would use the donation wisely. But the unfortunate reality behind this lack of trust is that we fail to practice the act of giving faithfully and sactificially. The Bible teaches us that the more we give the more we will receive back, whether directly or indirectly. If you&rsquo;re in a spot where you just absolutely cannot trust your Church with your money, please go find a new church and pour yourself out there.">

</h2>
<p>Verse 10 shows a yearly practice of eating unleavened bread with the purpose of remembering what God has done for them. Note that unleavened bread, in the old testament, symbolizes <strong>purity</strong> and <strong>freedom of sin</strong>. This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to just be a ritualistic tradition that occurs every year. Rather, a way of life that&rsquo;s <strong>rhythmic</strong> and <em>reminds us of Jesus&rsquo; actions</em>. Make this a life-long commitment. Make it your utmost priority to attend worship service every week. It will provide you a rhythm of renewal and repentance. It will keep your heart rooted in the Word. On the other end, when you don&rsquo;t attend, you are prioritizing other things over God. And consequently, you will slowly forget about the wonderful truth.</p>

</h2>
<p>Verse 21-22 conveys that God wasn&rsquo;t just with them during the journey, but he was there <strong>before the journey began</strong>. God is preparing everything for you. Our role in our lives is not to chart the course, but just to follow and trust in God&rsquo;s plan. Build a rhythm of daily prayer grounded in the Word of God. This will help you to <strong>align your heart</strong> with God&rsquo;s heart, and will help you discern how God is working/moving in your life.</p>
