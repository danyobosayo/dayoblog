verse: Daniel 5:1-7, 13-31
Summary: The new King Belshazzar, the successor of King Nebuchadnezzar disrespected God by drinking from the chalices from the temple (the house of God). The feast is reckless because he&rsquo;s chasing dopamine desperately before his death.

  Reckless life that speaks to humanity
  #


What does it mean to be reckless?
It&rsquo;s to desperately chase something with no avail.
When death is imminent, it is human nature to indulge in sensuality and pleasure.
Recklessness can be seen in cheating as well. People cheat because they crave and desire something that isn&rsquo;t being found within the relationship.


  Revelation based on this recklessness
  #


Wisdom can not be found anywhere in the world, only in the word of God.
You are a created being by a marvelous creator. You need to turn to your creator to learn more about them.


  What we need to do as people who are believing in the word of God, our responsibility.
  #


Trust in the word of God. He is the only true source of wisdom.
When you reject the word of God, it leads to destruction.
In verse 22 it shows that Kiny Belshazzar knew all of the good works of God and his eminence, however he deliberately CHOSE to worship the idols of this world.

If you are a christian, and truly know the word of God, you need to abide to it. Or else God will judge you.
All Christians will be judged but not condemned.
To avoid condemnation, we need to believe in the death and resurrection of the Son, Jesus Christ.


We don&rsquo;t get to earn or work for our salvation, but the rewards that we reap in heaven are based upon our trust in him and our works?
God revealed to us his truth, and it is our calling to act on this truth. We need to be vessels of life, not of waste.
If you think of yourself as a vessel of God and mercy, you will start to act holier. Jesus was the ultimate vessel sacrifice that allows us to be vessels of mercy. If we do this as temples of the holy spirit, we will find signficance and meaning within our lives. Will we ever find satsifcation, meaning, or joy, when you achieve everyrhing for just yourself. You will only be more and more concerned sbout the future. When we act as a vessel of mercy, not only do we find significance in our lives, we start to experience joy. We start to not be shaken by our external circumstances. You will realize the joy thet God has revealed and provided to us really means, because this is how we were designed to be.
Stay disciplined and firm with the word of God
