verse: Daniel 12:1-13
[[Time Anxiety]]
But time is a gift.
Hold firmly to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, trust in his plan.
We need to have the courage to wait beyond time. What does this mean?

  Why is time so valuable?
  #


How we spend our time is how we define our identity.
&ldquo;Faster is better&rdquo; is an idea that many people in society identify themselves with. Many of us believe that there is value in speed and efficiency.
[[Time Famine]] is the idea that no matter how hard we try, we cannot accomplish everything that we desire.
Time is supposed to be a gift from God to Cherish, but it has devolved into something else.


  What does waiting do to us? The benefit?
  #


Waiting shifts our identity into people of holiness rather than hopelessness.
A difficult season of waiting is not accidental. There&rsquo;s a purpose for our trials. &ldquo;Blessed is he who waits&rdquo;
Periods of waiting allow us to remove impurities and strife.  It strengthens our faith in God. Actively waiting produces holiness.
The wicked will respond to waiting with wickedness and strife. But believers who wait on God actively by keeping their faith will be rewarded.
DO NOT FEAR: your job is not to climb a ladder or sprint in a race. It&rsquo;s to wait for God to let you do as you do.


  How are we to be people that wait beyond time?
  #


Waiting isn&rsquo;t an obstacle, it&rsquo;s not an obstruction. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to look forward to and feel excited about because it&rsquo;s a chance for us to show our piety.
Remember God&rsquo;s providence and promises

It&rsquo;s not about the circumstance we find ourselves in. It&rsquo;s about who we are and who is behind us, which is God.
God promises us an eternal inheritance.
