They will see the preciousness of Jesus. You can create a little heaven wherever you go. You can be light to them.</p><p>God has to be the primary. Every relationship needs to be founded on Jesus.</p><p><strong>How do we practically get here?</strong>
Submitting to one another in a reverance for Christ.
Give yourself to your wife. To lead your wife to Christlikeness
Do not command or direct. It&rsquo;s humble sacrificalness. The manliest thing you can do is falling on your knees in prayer to God.</p><p>Be generous in the way you treat your employees. Be giving. And as an employee, treat your employer with love and kindness. With hard work and christ like action. how can we submit to those above and below us? Seek the fullness of the spirit in your life daily. actively intentionally. Daily seeking and submission to God. Ask God for this fullness, to help us. For God you will do anything to fix your approach of life. Challenge yourself in a group of believers. When you are filled, you wont know by emotional ecstasy, but you will want to make melodies for Christ. You will be thankful for every matter of your life, even when things are going awry to God. A heart of thanksgiving for God. You will be thankful that God remains by your side through everything. You will desire and want to submit to others. All because of what Jesus Christ has done for us. This is the life of God we must follow.</p></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
