verse: Exodus 1:1-22
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find any mention of God, miracles, signs, or any amazing parables. Rather hardship, suffering, oppression. But you will see that God is still deeply in work.&rdquo;

  Why is God silent sometimes?
  #


To give us hope to something greater. Contextually, the Israelites have experienced an absence of God for roughly 400 years. In verse 1, we see the geneological descendants of Abraham in order to show that God is working on the promises he made back in Genesis. God is always there. And he has a masterful plan.
God builds slowly. We see that the people nation of Israel grow to great heights. God has been faithfully helping them multply and grow into a nation. God siliently aided the Israelites.


  What is God doing during these lulls?
  #


Silence does not equate to God not working with us. He is always with us and constantly watching over us and working within us. He is always holding our hand. Stand firm and abide in Him.
There will be worldly things that will try to pull you away from trusting in God. They will rip you apart and tear you to pieces. And God allows these moments too. God continues to stay silent but also continues to work. This is because he cares about us and would rather us grow than bring immediate relief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not punishment, it&rsquo;s preparation for something better&rdquo;.


  How should we navigate through these quiet times?
