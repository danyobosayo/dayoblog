      <description>&lt;p&gt;series: An inviting God&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;verse: Genesis 2:16-17&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Human souls were not made to bear outcomes. We are not in control of the way things turn out. But God does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Garden of Eden was a place of abundance. This story isn&amp;rsquo; about restriction and limitation and rules. God asks us to care for and maintain this beautiful orchard. We just have to take part of our own responsibilities, and also enjoy the fruit. God invites us to eat until we cant anymore. This center tree is also good but we are just not ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
