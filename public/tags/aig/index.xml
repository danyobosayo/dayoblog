&lt;p>verse: Genesis 2:16-17&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human souls were not made to bear outcomes. We are not in control of the way things turn out. But God does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Garden of Eden was a place of abundance. This story isn&amp;rsquo; about restriction and limitation and rules. God asks us to care for and maintain this beautiful orchard. We just have to take part of our own responsibilities, and also enjoy the fruit. God invites us to eat until we cant anymore. This center tree is also good but we are just not ready.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is Home?</title><link>http://localhost:65252/sermons/what-is-home/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:65252/sermons/what-is-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: An inviting God&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Ephesians 5&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is home? Home is joy comfort rest security etc
But it can also have conflict bitterness frustration and abuse.
Everyone desires a home to be filled with joy But is this possible?
How do people relate to each other? How do we be more christ like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesus Christ must be lord in all your relations. family, lover, employer. in everything. Have Christ be the center of your relationship. Every aspect in life is grounded in Christ. This is a picture of heaven on Earth, and heaven is our home.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
