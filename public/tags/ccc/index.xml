&lt;p>verse: Daniel 12:1-13&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[[Time Anxiety]]
But time is a gift.
Hold firmly to God&amp;rsquo;s sovereignty, trust in his plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to have the courage to wait beyond time. What does this mean?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-time-so-valuable">
 Why is time so valuable?
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#why-is-time-so-valuable">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How we spend our time is how we define our identity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Faster is better&amp;rdquo; is an idea that many people in society identify themselves with. Many of us believe that there is value in speed and efficiency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[[Time Famine]] is the idea that no matter how hard we try, we &lt;strong>cannot&lt;/strong> accomplish everything that we desire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time is supposed to be a gift from God to Cherish, but it has devolved into something else.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-waiting-do-to-us-the-benefit">
 What does waiting do to us? The benefit?
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#what-does-waiting-do-to-us-the-benefit">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Waiting shifts our identity into people of &lt;strong>holiness&lt;/strong> rather than &lt;strong>hopelessness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A difficult season of waiting is not accidental. There&amp;rsquo;s a purpose for our trials. &amp;ldquo;Blessed is he who waits&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Periods of waiting allow us to remove impurities and strife. It strengthens our faith in God. Actively waiting produces holiness.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The wicked will respond to waiting with wickedness and strife. But believers who wait on God actively by keeping their faith will be rewarded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DO NOT FEAR&lt;/strong>: your job is not to climb a ladder or sprint in a race. It&amp;rsquo;s to wait for God to let you do as you do.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-are-we-to-be-people-that-wait-beyond-time">
 How are we to be people that wait beyond time?
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#how-are-we-to-be-people-that-wait-beyond-time">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Waiting isn&amp;rsquo;t an obstacle, it&amp;rsquo;s not an obstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to look forward to and feel excited about because it&amp;rsquo;s a chance for us to show our piety.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Remember God&amp;rsquo;s providence and promises&lt;/em>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s not about the circumstance we find ourselves in. It&amp;rsquo;s about who we are and who is behind us, which is God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God promises us an eternal inheritance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>verse: Daniel 4:28-37
King Nebuchadnezzar is humiliated and humbled because he was so prideful. Not just a boastful nature, but a &lt;strong>spiritual pride&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do we have spiritual pride?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spiritual pride leaves to an obsession with control. Nebechadnezzar thinks that the fruits of his labor all came by his own doing. Spiritual restoration occured when he let go of his control and gave all glory to God most high.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Wisdom of God</title><link>http://localhost:61827/sermons/the-wisdom-of-god/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61827/sermons/the-wisdom-of-god/</guid><description>&lt;p>series: Counter Cultural Convictions&lt;/p>
&lt;p>verse: Daniel 2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to recognize that we are NEVER in control of our lives, no matter how much we want to believe otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where do we place our trust in today? Ourselves, our pride?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is wisdom?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>God&amp;rsquo;s insight for the &lt;em>best&lt;/em> way to live.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The book of Daniel shows this when God reveals the mystery when no person of flesh could.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We need to discernment and insight into how God is working in our lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recognize that GOD is in control &lt;strong>not us&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is our response to times of need?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It should be God and his godly wisdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why do we need wisdom?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
