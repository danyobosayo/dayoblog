&lt;p>verse: Mark 14:1-11&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In this verse we find a woman who pours an alabaster flask which is worth a year&amp;rsquo;s wage and dumps it on Jesus. It&amp;rsquo;s an expressive act that emphasizes her love for Jesus Christ. This in juxtoposition to Judas betraying Jesus for mere dollars demonstrates how being faithful to Christ will &lt;em>cost&lt;/em> us in a &lt;em>worldly&lt;/em> sense, and &lt;em>rejecting&lt;/em> God will barely provide benefit to us in the worldy sense.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Jesus was sinless and lived a perfect life. Yet he lives in a sinless broken world, so how can we act accordingly and similarly to him.
In other words, what does God want from his people?
Well obviously obedience, but what does that look like?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Soil Parable</title><link>http://localhost:61827/sermons/the-soil-parable/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:61827/sermons/the-soil-parable/</guid><description>&lt;p>2024-10-11

&lt;p>verse: Mark 4:1-34
Parable of the 4 seeds. Jesus preaching to a big group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesus is trying to teach his disciples: &amp;ldquo;The sower sows the Word&amp;rdquo;. The truth be spread and shared to many people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all types of soil, one of four&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Hear the truth but it has zero impact on them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rocky Soil - hear it but doesnt receive it
Thorns - getting distracted with other desires and things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XX&lt;/li>
