&lt;p>verse: Daniel 3
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are cast into the fire for not worshipping Nevuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s idol. They survive through the power of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are human. We have fears of failure and an expectation of loss. We all live in &lt;strong>fire&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Main idea: So how can we hold on to our convictions without being consumed by the fire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pluralism: What we think about the &lt;strong>most&lt;/strong> is our god. It becomes our greatest concern.
When does suffering consume us
When we stop focusing our time and attention on God
How does God deliver us in those moments.
By encountering Him. Recognize his presence and in his divine protection. He will be WITH us through hard moments rather than removing them. And this is because our God is relational, not a wish maker. He cares and loves us and relates with us. A personal encounter with God in these hard times affirms our love and faithfulness with God.
What do we do to hold on to these convictions.
Focus on the &amp;ldquo;fourth man&amp;rdquo; and not on the fire/heat. Be confident and focused on God.
Recognize that God&amp;rsquo;s suffering was our means for salvation&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
